## Model Performance Data Widgets

The **Model Analytics** dashboard displays the widgets given below to represent the [model-specific performance](../analytics/model-analytics-dashboard.md/#model-specific-metrics){:target="_blank"} metrics. The graphs update automatically when a different model deployment version is selected.

### How it Works

1. Select the required date/range in the [Global Timeline Filter](../analytics/tools-analytics-dashboard.md/#global-timeline-filters){:target="_blank"}.
2. Select the tab for the required model type, like *Fine-tuned*, *Open-source*, or *External*.
3. If you have selected the **Fine-tuned** or **Open-source** tab, select the model name and (optional) version. Alternatively, select the provider from the dropdown under **External Models**.
4. The widgets display an hourly graph for 24 hours per day and a daily graph for the respective metrics for a date range.

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p><ul><li>The widget shows data only for the duration that the model was deployed in your account. For instance, if Model A was active for 4 days last week and undeployed for the next 3 days, selecting a 7-day view will display data solely for those 4 active days and the associated request times.</li>
<li>The graph will show curves only when requests are processed by the model. If no requests are processed during an hour or day, no data points will appear.</li></ul></p></div>

### Model Latency

This widget is available for **Fine-tuned**, **Open-source**, and **External** models. It features a line graph illustrating the selected model version’s latency during the selected period in the [Global Timeline Filter](../analytics/model-analytics-dashboard.md/#global-timeline-filters){:target="_blank"}. The Y-axis represents the **Latency** in milliseconds, and the X-axis indicates the **Date**. 

**Key Features**

* A blue line graph represents the **Latency** if the selected period is 24 hours or 7 days. The **Average Latency** graph is displayed when you select a date range above 7 days.
* The **Latency** (Y-axis) automatically scales according to the requests the model executes for the selected period.
* Hover over a data point on the line graph to view the latency for a specific request when selecting a 24-hour or 7-day period or the average latency for a specific date and time when using a longer date range. For example, you can check the latency for an individual request in the last 24 hours or the average latency (aggregated for all requests per day) on January 16, 2024, at 11:35 AM.

**Best Practices**

You can do the following to analyze model performance:

* **Latency Tracking and Trend Analysis**: Tracking latency over various periods offers valuable insights into performance trends, helping to identify peak usage and low-efficiency times. This helps further fine-tune your model for improved performance. 
* **Real-Time Monitoring and Comparative Analysis**: The widget enables real-time performance tracking and comparison of the deployed model versions, allowing you to quickly respond to sudden latency spikes and identify the best-performing option.
* **Track Credits Usage**: Track credit usage for model deployment and fine-tuning, based on average latency over time, to optimize resource allocation and manage costs efficiently.

### Requests

This widget is available for **Fine-tuned**, **Open-source**, and **External** models. It features two dynamic graphs illustrating successful and failed requests executed by the model during the selected period in the [Global Timeline Filter](../analytics/model-analytics-dashboard.md/#global-timeline-filters){:target="_blank"}. The Y-axis represents the **Number of Requests**, and the X-axis indicates the selected **Date**.

**Key Features**

* Successful runs are displayed in green, and failed runs are shown in red.
* The **Number of Requests** (Y-axis) automatically scales to accommodate increased requests across different date selections.
* Hover over a data point on the success and failure line graphs to view the number of successful or failed requests at that specific date and time, as well as the total number of successful or failed requests executed by the model for the selected duration. For example, you can check the request counts at 11:25 AM on January 16, 2024. Additionally, the total number of successful or failed requests between January 1 and January 31 is displayed.
* **Total Requests** represents the total of successful and failed requests executed by the model during the selected period.
* **Avg. credits per request**: The value is calculated by dividing the total number of credits consumed by the model by the total number of responses generated by the model for the requests it processed.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Avg. credits per request is not displayed for external models.</p></div>

<img src="../images/requests-hover-info.png" alt="requests hover info" title="requests hover info" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

**Best Practices**

You can do the following to analyze the model’s performance:

* **Performance Tracking**: By viewing successful and failed requests, you can monitor the model’s performance, identifying how often the model responds successfully versus when they fail for the same or different dates.
* **Trend Analysis**: Tracking requests across different periods provides insights into performance trends, identifying peak and low-performance periods.
* **Real-Time Monitoring**: The widget allows you to monitor model performance in real time, enabling quick responses to sudden spikes in failures or performance drops.
* **Comparative Assessment**: Evaluate the performance of different model versions to determine the most effective option.

### Model Scaling and Usage

This widget is available for **Fine-tuned** and **Open-source** models. It features a step graph illustrating the usage and scaling, meaning the number of replicas (with a specific [hardware configuration](../../../models/hardware-pricing.md){:target="_blank"} deployed for the selected model version in the [Model Performance Filter](../analytics/model-analytics-dashboard.md/#model-performance-filters){:target="_blank"} and the period in the [Global Timeline Filter](../analytics/tools-analytics-dashboard.md/#global-timeline-filters){:target="_blank"}. The Y-axis represents the **Number of Replicas**, and the X-axis indicates the selected **Date**.

**Key Features**

* A blue step graph represents the **Number of Replicas** for the specified hardware configuration deployed in your account. It shows when fewer, more, or the same number of model replicas are deployed to generate responses.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>"<b>Multiple Hardware</b>" is displayed when replicas with more than one hardware configuration are deployed across a date range.</p></div>


* The Y-axis automatically adjusts based on the increase in the deployed replicas during the selected period.
* Each upward step in the graph represents the generation of additional model replicas, continuing until deployment is complete (indicated by the Max Replicas line). The downward steps show the undeployment of replicas.
* Hover over a data point on the step graph to view the timestamp, deployment version name, number of replicas, and hardware configuration deployed at that point by the model version. For example, you can check the replicas and hardware usage on January 16, 2024, at 11:35 AM for the last 30 days.
