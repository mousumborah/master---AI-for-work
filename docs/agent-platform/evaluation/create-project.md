# Projects

In Evaluation Studio, projects act as the core containers for organizing evaluations. Each project can store multiple evaluations, and each evaluation contains a distinct dataset.

### Key Features

* **Project Management**: Users can create, rename, and delete projects as needed. When a project is deleted, all associated evaluations and datasets are also removed, ensuring a clean slate.
* **Collaboration**: Projects can be easily shared with collaborators, enabling seamless teamwork and collaborative model assessments. User invitations are limited to the project level; users cannot be invited at the evaluation level.
* **Permissions**: Permissions determine who can create, view, or manage evaluations within the project. Permissions are applied consistently across all evaluations within a project. Once users are invited to a project and begin creating evaluations, they will have access to all evaluations within that project based on their role.

## Roles and Permissions in Evaluation Studio

In Evaluation Studio, roles and permissions help manage who can access and modify projects and evaluations.

**Key Roles:**

* **Admin**: Full access to create, modify, and delete projects and evaluations. Admins can also manage user permissions and invite new users.
* **Editor**: Can create and modify evaluations within a project, but cannot manage users or project-level settings.
* **Viewer**: Read-only access. Viewers can:
    * View all evaluations and scores
    * View score explanations
    * View evaluator properties

4. Click **Create** to submit the project creation request.
Once the project is created successfully, the system will redirect you to the newly created projectâ€™s main page.

5. On the Project page, click the three dots icon in the row of the project you want to manage for the following options:
    * **Rename**: Use this option to change the project name. 
    * **Delete**: Use this option to delete the project. A confirmation message appears, asking for confirmation to delete the project. If the user confirms, the project and all its associated datasets will be permanently deleted.
    * **Share**: Use this option to share the project with other users by providing email addresses or user identifiers.
