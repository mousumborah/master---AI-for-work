# About Tools

Tools can automate processes, streamline workflows, generate insights, and produce outputs such as deal summaries or emails. The tool builder empowers you to create AI-powered workflows and automations using a visual drag-and-drop interface with little to no coding required. You can easily configure settings, combine multiple workflows, and integrate with systems like AWS.

### Key Features

* **Tool Flow**: A visual no-code/low-code builder for creating and managing tool flows and versions. It uses nodes and transitions to help you automate end-to-end tasks without writing complex code. [Learn more](./create-a-new-tool.md).

* **Sharing & Permissions**: Account owners can invite users to collaborate on specific Tools. Invited users can access the Models and Data modules for the invited account and see only the Tools they are invited to. [Learn more](./manage-user-roles-and-permissions.md).

* **Tool Endpoint**: After building and testing your tool flow, you can deploy it. Once deployed, you'll receive an API endpoint for your tool, which you can use to integrate it with other systems. [Learn more](./deploy-a-tool.md).

* **API Keys**: Create API keys for your deployed tools to access them from external systems securely. Share these keys only with trusted users. [Learn more](./create-a-new-api-key.md).

* **Tool Monitor**: Track and analyze your tools' performance across multiple runs gaining a comprehensive, time-based view of tool activities to optimize your AI operations. [Learn more](./agent-monitor/about-agent-monitor.md).

* **Guardrails**: Deploy various guardrail models and use them to scan LLM requests and responses to enforce safety and appropriateness standards. [Learn more](./guardrails/add-a-scanner.md).

* **Audit Logs**: Track the audit logs of all activities within your tool flows and quickly troubleshoot issues with real-time event tracking. [Learn more](./tool-audit-log.md).

* **Configurations**: Manage your tool's general details, define reusable values and configurations using environment variables, and undeploy the tool. [Learn more](./configure-a-tool.md).
