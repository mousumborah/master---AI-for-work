# Create a Tool

You can create a new tool to leverage models, build flows, and later deploy it as an endpoint. You can start the tool creation journey from the Tools page. The page also allows you to manage your existing tools and view the tools that have been shared with you by others.

Steps to create a tool:

1. On the **Tools** page, click **Create a new tool**. The **New tool** dialog box is displayed.

2. Enter a name and a brief description for the tool and click **Create**. The tool is created, and the **Tool Flow** option is displayed. You can start creating your tool flow now.
