# Tool Flow Change Log

The Tool flow change log enables admins to track, audit, and review changes made to an tool's flow over time. This feature enables transparency and accountability by providing a history of all actions taken within the flow, including updates to node properties, user changes, and version-specific modifications, making it ideal for monitoring tool flow evolution and managing collaborative work.

The change log, accessible through the admin console, is an essential tool for tracking user activities and understanding the impact of changes made within the tool's flow.

## Key Features

* **Event tracking**: The change log records each time a user exits a property field in a node, capturing the timestamp, the user responsible for the change, and the change made.
* **Filters for enhanced searchability**: Admins can filter the change log to easily track changes over time, by node, or by specific team members.

## Using the Tool Flow Change Log

The change log automatically records every change made within the tool flow whenever a user exits a property field in any node. You can quickly scroll through the log to review the complete history of changes made across the flow.

### Accessing the Change Log

1. Open the tool flow of the tool for which you want to view the change log.
2. Click the **History/Log** icon at the top-right corner of the page.
The change log opens in a panel on the right.

### Viewing the Change Log

Once the change log panel opens, you will see a list of entries corresponding to different actions made inside the tool flow. The most recent changes will appear first in the log.

Each log entry will display the following:

* The timestamp of when the change was made.
* A brief description of the change.
* The name of the user who made the change.

### Filtering the Change Log

1. At the top of the change log panel, you can see filter options to help you refine your search.
2. Use the following filter options:
    1. **Date filter**: Click the Calendar icon to select a specific date range to view changes made within that period.
    2. **Filter By**: Click the Filter icon to filter the logs by:
        1. **User**: View the changes made by a specific user.
        2. **Node Type**: Choose the type of node you want to track.

    The log will dynamically update based on the selected filter(s), making it easy to find relevant entries.
