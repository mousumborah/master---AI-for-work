# About AI Nodes

AI nodes are multimodal components that utilize LLMs for specialized tasks, transforming workflows by supporting diverse file types. These nodes can process and generate various media formats, such as text, images, and audio, within a single workflow. Their adaptability enables developers to build dynamic systems that seamlessly handle and manipulate multiple data types.

Each AI node processes inputs and generates responses, which can be integrated into broader workflows within the tool flow. AI nodes are categorized into the following types:

* **Text to Text Nodes**

     * Process textual input and generate textual output based on the given instructions.
     * Used for tasks like summarization, translation, content generation, and chatbot interactions.
     * Example: AI-powered documentation assistants, automated report generation. [Learn more](../types-of-nodes/text-to-text-node.md){:target="_blank"}.

* **Text to Image Nodes**

    * Convert textual descriptions into visual representations/relevant images based on the instructions and keywords you provide.
    * Used for generating AI art, concept sketches, and synthetic images.
    * Example: AI-driven design tools, creative content generation. [Learn more](../types-of-nodes/text-to-image-node.md){:target="_blank"}.

* **Audio to Text Nodes** 

    * Convert spoken words (in multiple languages) in an audio file into written text using text transcription. 
    * Used in transcription, voice assistants, and speech analysis.
    * Example: Automated meeting transcriptions, AI-driven voice command processing. [Learn more](../types-of-nodes/audio-to-text-node.md){:target="_blank"}.

* **Image to Text Nodes**

    * Extract meaningful text from images.
    * Used for OCR (Optical Character Recognition), image captioning, and content analysis.
    * Example: AI-powered document scanners, and accessibility tools. [Learn more](../types-of-nodes/image-to-text-node.md){:target="_blank"}.
