# Audit Logs

Agent Platformâ€™s comprehensive Audit Logs provides full visibility into user actions and system interactions, tracking logins, role changes, and model updates through dynamic time-stamped logs and tracking capabilities.

This empowers admins to ensure compliance with internal policies and regulations, while proactively mitigating risks like data privacy breaches and algorithmic bias.

Each log entry includes the following to provide actionable insights on account and tool-level activities:

- Event name and category.
- The user who performed the action.
- Date and time of the event.
- Detailed description of the action.

The event metadata provides business users with actionable insights, helping them in efficiently identifying patterns in user activities within their accounts. It also aids in detecting anomalies, spotting unauthorized usage, and enhancing overall account security.

You can specify a **current** or **past period** to view the logs and have complete visibility into the activities and modifications in your account. [Learn more](./audit-logs.md#steps-to-set-time-range-for-audit-logs){:target="_blank"}.

Additionally, you can set **custom filters** based on a specific category, event, or user value to view only the required audit logs. [Learn more](./audit-logs.md#steps-to-add-a-custom-filter){:target="_blank"}.
