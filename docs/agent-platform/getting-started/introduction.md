* **Multi-Agent Orchestration** provides a low-code platform with declarative agent programming for reasoning, planning, action, and reflection, along with end-to-end streaming on voice and chat interactions.

* **Actions / Tools** offer workflow and custom-code tools with support for JavaScript and Python functions, as well as pre-built integrations with popular applications.

* **Search / RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) includes 100+ pre-built data agents with built-in role-based access, AI-powered extraction and enrichment, and hybrid, agentic, and context-aware retrieval.

* **Interaction Context** enables end-to-end state management of the interaction, conversation context enrichment using shortâ€”and long-term memory, and synchronous and asynchronous execution with human-in-the-loop.

* **Models** allow fine-tuning and optimizing models, deploying open-source models, and integrating with external models.

* **Prompts** includes a prompts library, collaboration and experimentation features, and versioning and deployment capabilities.

* **Evaluation** helps measure and improve AI performance systematically through custom scoring criteria using AI and human evaluations and continuous monitoring.

* **AI Safety** ensures anonymization of PII and sensitive information, input and output guardrails, and role-based access controls to data.

* **Analytics** captures usage logs of models and agents, session logs and conversation history, and metrics and dashboards.

* **Observability** enables end-to-end tracing of the orchestration, explainability of reasoning and actions, and support for streaming of thoughts.

* **Agent Protocol** provides an end-to-end API with support for multimodal content, streaming, and external agent integration.

* **SDKs** are available for Agents, Tools, RAG, and Traces with standardized interfaces and a managed infrastructure.

* **Enterprise Grade CI/CD** supports granular versioning with the ability to deploy multiple logical environments (for example, QA, UAT, Prod).

* **Collaboration and Audit** enable multi-user collaboration with customizable roles and comprehensive audit logs.

* **Marketplace** provides prebuilt templates for agents and tools for multiple domains and use cases.
