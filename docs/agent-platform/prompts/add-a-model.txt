# Add a Model

Once you have given your prompts in the Prompt box, you can test your prompts across different AI model(s) and decide on the required model.

Steps to add a model:


1. Click the required **Experiment** from the **Experiments** page. The **Prompt experiments** page is displayed.
2. Click **Add Model** in the model response section. A pop-up with a list of options is displayed.
1. Click **Manage models** from the list of options.

    You will be redirected to the External models page to add a model. For more information about how to add an external model, see [Add an external model](../models/external-models/add-an-external-model-using-easy-integration.md).

    !!! note

        Follow the preceding process of adding an external model only if you are adding any model for the first time. If you have already added a model, it is automatically displayed in the pop-up list when you click the **Add model** button. For example, if you have added the Claude-v1 model from Anthropic then it is displayed in the pop-up and you click to select the model as shown in the following image.

    You can add other models also to compare and decide which model provides the suitable output for your prompt. 

2. In the added model section click the **+** icon corresponding to the model’s name.  A pop-up with a list of options is displayed.

1. Repeat step 3 to add another model to compare the outputs. 
2. Click the **Model setting** icon corresponding to the model’s name to make any changes in the settings of the base model you have selected. 
3. Click **Generate Output** after you have added the required number of models to compare. The Generated output for comparison is displayed in the Model section of the Prompt playground space for your reference as shown in the following image.
