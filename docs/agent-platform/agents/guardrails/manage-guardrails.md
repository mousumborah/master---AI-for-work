# Manage Guardrails

To use input and output scanners in Agent Platform, you need to deploy them first. Once deployed, a scanner will be available across all your tools on the platform.

Steps to deploy a scanner:

1. Click **Settings** in the top navigation bar.

2. In the left navigation pane, click **Manage Guardrails**.

3. On the Manage guardrail models page, click the **Deploy** button next to the scanner you want to deploy.  

    The deployment process starts, and the status is displayed as **Deploying**. Once the scanner is deployed, it's available in the scanners list when a new scanner is added.

    !!! note

        If you no longer need a scanner, click the **Undeploy** button next to the scanner to remove it from the platform.
