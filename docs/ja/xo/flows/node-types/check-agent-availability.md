# Check Agent Availability Node

This node checks agent availability based on skills and decides the next node to run within the experience flow.

!!!Note

    Please be aware that the Check Agent Availability node is experimental and may be deprecated in a future release.

## Configure the Node

### General Settings

Click the **General Settings** icon and provide the following information:

1. Provide a **Custom Name** by which to identify the node.
2. In the **Choose Skills** drop-down, specify the skills or skill groups which you want to check agent availability for.
3. Select the **Check for specific agents** checkbox to search for specific agents in the text field. This will restrict the node to only checking availability among the selected agents.

    !!!Note

        You can check agent availability either based on skills or agents. Both criteria cannot be used together.
4. Under **Output**, you can select nodes to define the following:
    1. **The success path (If an agent is available)**: The flow is directed to the selected node from the current node if an available is found, according to the criteria set above.
    2. **The failure path (If no agent is available)**: The flow is directed to the selected node from the current node if an available agent is not found, according to the criteria set above.

After providing node connections within the Output section, your flow might look similar to the example below, with both the success and the failure paths drawn on the canvas.
