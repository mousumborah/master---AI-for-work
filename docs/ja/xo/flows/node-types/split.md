# Split Node

This node enables you to split incoming queries based on specific conditions to reduce inbound traffic. These conditions use context variables that define the scope of usage in the dialog task and intent transition conditions.

The syntax for defining a context variable is:

```
context.contextvariable.<< context variable name >>
```

For example, _intent_ is a context variable that defines the customer’s intent for a dialog. This variable can be defined in the condition as:

```
context.intent.<< intent name >>
```

Context variables are managed via the Kore.ai XO Platform. [Learn more](../../automation/intelligence/context-object.md).

!!! Note

    The split node is designed to support a maximum of 10 branches.

## Configure the Node

### General Settings

Click the **General Settings** icon and set up the following conditions:

1. A **Custom Name** to identify the node.
2. Under **_Execute branches where condition matches_**, define the _IF/ELSE-IF/ELSE_ conditions using context variables and the AND/OR operator.
    1. **_IF _**– Directs the flow on a specific path if specific criteria are met.
    2. **_ELSE-IF_**– This condition allows you to configure another set of criteria to be met by the flow when the criteria in the initial _If_ condition are not met.
    3. **_ELSE_**– Directs the flow on a specific path if the set criteria are not met.
3. Under the first **Action** dropdown, select the **Branch Name** in the dropdown to route the logic to this branch if the conditions above are met.
4. Click **_Add ELSE-IF_** to add another set of criteria to be met if the previous ones are not.
5. Under the second **Action** dropdown, select the branch name corresponding to the **_ELSE_** condition. The flow will route to this branch if the _IF/ELSE_-IF criteria are not met.

    !!!Note

        The condition setup in Contact Center AI is similar to that of the Automation AI process. [Learn more](../../automation/use-cases/dialogs/node-connections/nodes-conditions.md).

You can delete a condition by clicking on the **Delete** (bin) icon next to it.

### Error Handling

Use this section to handle system errors during customer interactions.

* **Your Message to User**: The message that will be played or displayed to the customer. Select one of the following options from under **Choose your message type**:
    * **Text to speech**: This option allows you to transcribe text to speech. Type the text to be transcribed in the textbox or select an already configured message.
        * Create a new prompt message to be played out for the **Text to Speech** message type by clicking **+ Create New**. Enter a name for your message, and type its contents.
        * Define multiple message types for the prompt message to be played to the customer by clicking **+ Add Another**. In this case, one message will be randomly selected and played during runtime.

* **Go to node**: Select the node to which you want to direct the error handling flow and define the system behavior. You can create a new node by selecting a node type or identifying and selecting an existing node.
