# Introduction to Flows

## What Are Flows?

A _flow_ is a step-by-step process that helps you define the end-to-end customer experience at a contact center for each communication channel. Flows can be built using the Flow Designer.

## What Is the Flow Designer?

The Flow Designer is a tool that allows you to quickly set up both simple and complex customer experiences. It is a drag-and-drop work surface that enables you to link together blocks of actions called _nodes_. These nodes help you map the customer experience from the initial contact to the query allocation to an agent, a bot, or both.

The Flow Designer also allows you to link Contact Center AI to an XO Platform Bot to handle the customer request, potentially resolve it, or otherwise transfer it to an agent.

## Why Use the Flow Designer?

There are a few benefits to using the Flow Designer:

* The Flow Designer provides visibility on how the use cases, waiting experience, the default, and the other contact flow modules work together.
* It allows you to design and view the end-to-end customer experience flow in one place.
* This open visual canvas lets you drag nodes, link them together, and create clear customer experience flows without coding.
* You can build experiences based on whether you want customers to interact with a bot or be transferred to an agent.
* It allows you to create waiting experiences for situations when customers wait for an agent to accept the conversation request.
* It lets you design default flows and define how the application behaves in regular scenarios.

## The Flows Live Board

You can find the Flows by navigating to **Automation AI**/**Contact Center AI**/**Agent AI** > **Flows & Channels** > **FLOWS**.
