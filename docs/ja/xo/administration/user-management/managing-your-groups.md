# Managing Your Groups

On the **Groups** page in the **User Management** module, you can create and manage logically related groups of users, as well as import groups, such as your company Active Directory groups. If the enterprise has varied and distinct Bot requirements for various departments or lines of business, creating groups, adding developers and assigning bots to the groups would be the recommended option. You can create a custom group of users, for example, by geographical location, department title, or common interest. Groups are automatically created when you import organizational units using Active Directory. The following illustration is an example of the **Groups** page in the **User Management** module.
