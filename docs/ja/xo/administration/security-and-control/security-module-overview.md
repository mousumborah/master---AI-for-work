## Enterprise Key

On the **Enterprise Key** page in the **Security & Control** module of the Bots Admin Console, you can view, or regenerate your enterprise data encryption key.

By default, enterprise data, including user data, is automatically encrypted using this key when stored on Kore.ai servers. The encryption key is reissued every 60 days, or whenever manually refreshed by an admin.
