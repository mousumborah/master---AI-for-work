# Data Tables and Views


## Introduction

The Kore.ai XO Platform allows virtual assistant designers to view and manage the data mappings for tables and views using the Service Node in the data service. This helps improve the virtual assistantâ€™s performance by ensuring the correct values are mapped and used when viewing or updating details in the tables or views.

The Platform also  lets you transfer the ownership of data tables and views to other users of your workspace. You can also view the complete list of all data tables and views in the **Admin Console** to let your account or workspace administrators manage the ownership.

Once you change the Data Table owner, the new user can modify and manage the associated VAs and App assignments.
