# Agent Management

## Agent Groups

An **Agent Group** is a collection of agents based on skills, scopes, roles, functionalities, etc. Agents are assigned to groups to streamline customer service within Contact Center.

To find _Agent Groups_, go to **Contact Center AI** > **AGENT & SUPERVISORS** > **Agent Management**. All groups are visible on this page by default.

The Agent Group section includes the following features:

* You can use the **Search** field to find a group by name.

* Clicking any group name reveals the agents who are part of it. Each agent is listed with their name, Edit Action, Role, assigned Skills, and Queues. Learn more about [User Management](../../../user-management/manage-users.md).

### Pre-configured Groups

There are two pre-configured groups available:

Steps to enable and configure Login Prep status:

### Conversation Status Configuration

For each status, you can configure the following:

1. **The response time after which the status should trigger**: This can be set in either as a percent value of a total or as minutes and seconds.
    1. The statuses for which you can set a percent value are: _Due Reminder For Agent_, and _Idle Reminder For Customer._
    2. The statuses for which you can set a response time (in minutes and seconds) are: _Overdue, Agent Inactivity, Idle_, and _Auto Expire_.
    3. The statuses that do not require percentile or response time configuration are: _On Connect, On Interruption_, and _On Close_.  
    <img src="../images/response-status.png" alt="Status Configuration" title="Status Configuration" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">  
    The following applies to emails:
    4. The statuses for which you can set a response time (in hours) are _Due Reminder for Agent Inactivity_, and _Due Reminder for Auto Expiry_.
    5. The status for which there is no response time is _On Close_.
    6. The statuses for which you can set a response time (in hours and minutes) are _Overdue_, Agent _Inactivity_, _Agent Offline_, _Customer Idle_, and _Auto Expire_.
2. **The messaging goes out to either the user or the agent**. Status
Messages can be edited by clicking the Edit icon under the Message column.  
<img src="../images/status-edit.png" alt="Status Edit" title="Status Edit" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    7. Each status lets you edit the message text, add variables and select the language.
    <img src="../images/status-pop-up.png" alt="Status Message Dialog Box" title="Status Message Dilaog Box" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    8. **To add a variable**, place the cursor where you want to insert the variable, click the **Variable** field, then select the one you need. This adds a variable placeholder in your message text, which will be replaced with contextual information once the message reaches its recipient. You can select more than one variable within the same message.
    For example: `{{agentFirstName}}` becomes Christine Mark.  
    <img src="../images/select-variables.png" alt="Add Variable" title="Add Variable" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">  
See the tables in [Conversation Statuses by Channel (Live Chat, MEssaging, and Voice)](#conversation-statuses-by-channel-live-chat-messaging-and-voice) and [Conversation Statuses by Channel (Email)](#conversation-statuses-by-channel-email) for details on available variables.

Once you configure your Conversation Statuses and Messaging, click **Save** at the bottom right of the Agent Settings screen.

<img src="../images/call-recording-control.png" alt="Call Recording Control" title="Call Recording Control" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

### Allow Agent to Pause/Resume

By default, the Allow Agent to Pause/Resume feature is disabled. However, admins can enable it for agents handling voice interactions, allowing them to pause the recording during the call.

### Allow Virtual Assistant Dialogs to Pause/Resume

By default, the Allow Virtual Assistant to Pause/Resume feature is disabled. However, admins can enable it for virtual assistants (automation) handling voice interactions, allowing them to pause the recording when collecting [Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](../../configurations/advanced-settings/handling-sensitive-data.md).  
<img src="../images/allow-virtual-assistants-to-pause-resume.png" alt="Allow Virtual Assitant Dialogs to Pause/Resume Call Recording" title="Allow Virtual Assitant Dialogs to Pause/Resume Call Recording" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

Recorded calls are accessible to supervisors on the Dashboard’s [Interactions](../../../analytics/contact-center/interactions.md#call-recording) tab. The interactions are not recorded in the interactions tab for the duration that the recording was stopped/paused.

Changes to the Call Recording Control settings are logged on the [Kore.ai Bots Admin Console](../../../administration/adminconsole.md#accessing-the-admin-console) > Analytics > [Audit Report page](../../../administration/analytics.md#audit-report-details).

## Transfers

### Transfer to External Contacts

If enabled, this option allows agents to transfer ongoing customer calls to the external contacts list, via the Agent Console. Please see [Agent Console > Transfer Interactions](../../../console/interacting-with-customers.md#transfer-interactions) to learn more.  
<img src="../images/transfer-to-external-contacts.png" alt="Enable Transfer to External Contacts" title="Enable Transfer to External Contacts" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">
