# SMS Campaigns

SMS campaigns use text messages to reach and engage a target audience for marketing, informational, or transactional purposes. These campaigns use the SMS channel to deliver concise, impactful messages directly to users' mobile phones. SMS campaigns are versatile and used for promotions, alerts, reminders, surveys, and customer support, offering businesses a direct and efficient way to communicate with their audience.

You can access Campaigns by going to **Campaign Management** > **SMS**.
