# Agent Forms

In the Contact Center, Agent Forms provide a range of input fields that allow capturing required information from customers. Agent Forms work based on the Kore.ai XO Platform.

To reach the _Agent Forms_ section, go to **Contact Center AI > CONFIGURATIONS > Agent Forms**. Here, you can view and search existing forms and create new ones.
