# Skills

The **Skills** feature helps set up organizational classifications to route calls or chats to an agent based on the agent’s specialization, department, vertical, customer segment, and other categories. Examples of agent skills may include:

* **Languages** – Agents can speak different languages, such as English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. Language is considered a default skill that every agent must have.
* **Customer Interactions** – Agents are trained for retention, up-selling/cross-selling, or other related skills.

## The Skills Live Board

You can reach the Skills Live Board by going to **Contact Center** > **ROUTING** > **Skills**.

### Add a Skill Using a Script

You can use custom attributes to add skills dynamically.

You can dynamically add skills using script nodes while building [dialogs in the XO platform](../../../automation/use-cases/dialogs/node-types/working-with-the-script-node.md) or building a [flow in Contact Center AI](../../../flows/node-types/script-task.md).

The following methods are available:

**setSkills(skillsInfo)** – You can use this method to append skills to the current conversation. _skillsInfo_ is an array parameter.

```
var loanType = { //creating a sample variable of skill - loan type
    "Car Loan": {
         name: "Car Loan",
         id: "60b50bec5c4c1a4195b55d88",
    },
    "House Loan": {
         name: "House Loan",
         id: "60b50c005c4c1a4195b55d89",
    },
    "Education Loan": {
         name: "Education Loan",
         id: "60b894198afcca6accc5f466",
    },
    "Gold Loan": {
         name: "Gold Loan",
         id: "60b8943a8afcca6accc5f467",
    },
};

agentUtils.setSkills([loanType[a]]); //setting the skill - loan type
```

**getSkills()** – Returns an array of skills in the current conversation.

**getSkillById(skillId)** – Returns a skill using the skill ID. Skills IDs are available under skills.

**deleteSkillById(skillId)** – Deletes a skill from the context of the current conversation.

**deleteSkills(skillsToDelete)** – Deletes an array of skills from the context of the current conversation.
