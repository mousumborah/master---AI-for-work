# Task Execution-Based Containment Report API

This task-wise Containment Report offers a comparative analysis of the impact of task executions on overall containment. It breaks down task-wise successes and failures by containment type, including Drop-off, Self-service, and Agent Hand-off, providing a detailed overview for better understanding and decision-making.
