# Outbound Calling API (Kore.ai Voice Gateway)

Outbound calls can be made to external customers using Kore.ai Voice Gateway. The answering machine detection feature can be enabled on outbound calls to indicate whether a person or a machine has answered a call.

When the dialed call is answered, the answering machine detection feature starts listening to the outbound call, and after a short period, sends an indication of whether a person or a machine has answered the call.

This process happens in two parts:

1. The application triggers an Outbound Call.
2. Receiving Call Status Notifications.

# 1. Triggering the Outbound Call via API

The application triggers an outbound call using an HTTP POST request to the endpoint.
