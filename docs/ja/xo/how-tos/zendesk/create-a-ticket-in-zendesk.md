# Enable your AI Chatbot to Create a Ticket in Zendesk

You can streamline your customer support experience with our AI chatbot. Your end-users interact with the chatbot to resolve their queries. The assistant can tackle straightforward questions directly in the chat, saving users time and effort. For complex issues requiring more time or expertise or during non-office hours, the assistant can effortlessly guide users in creating a Zendesk support ticket. It can prompt users to collect the required information and create a ticket or convert the ongoing conversation into a ticket, keeping the conversation context in mind.
