# Configure SearchAssist

SearchAssist provides an intelligent, contextual, and personalized experience in every interaction across web and mobile channels. You can enhance the search capabilities of AgentAssist by integrating it with the SearchAssist application.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Set up SearchAssist**: Add all the information sources agents might need in their searches, like web pages, data, documents, and content from apps like ServiceNow and Confluence.
2. **Link SearchAssist with AgentAssist**: Administrators can link the SearchAssist application with the AgentAssist application, as explained in this document. Once linked, SearchAssist content is automatically available for AgentAssist as a service in runtime.
3. **View SearchAssist data in AgentAssist**: In the AgentAssist widget, agents can view relevant Snippets and Articles from the SearchAssist application, and Dialog tasks and FAQs from the XO Platform or the Use Cases of the AgentAssist application.

## **How Does It Help Agents?**

When AgentAssist is integrated with SearchAssist, data from all the sources configured in the SearchAssist application are accessible to agents via the AgentAssist widget > Library tab. In the search results, Snippets and Articles are shown from the SearchAssist application, and Dialog tasks and FAQs are shown from the Use Cases of the AgentAssist application. Agents can quickly review the results and refer to the relevant information. They can also share relevant information directly from the search results with the customer. The screenshot below is an example showing an agent searching for “pizza” on the Library tab.
