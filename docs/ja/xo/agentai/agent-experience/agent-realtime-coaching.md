# Agent Real-time Coaching

## Introduction
Contact center agents are often under pressure to provide better customer experiences. Dealing with high call volumes and complex conversations can make it challenging for agents to meet or exceed customer expectations without sufficient support, guidance, and tools.

The Real-time Agent Coaching feature enables real-time coaching based on the analysis of agent utterances and speech. You can set up specific utterances and speech patterns for AgentAssist to take relevant actions, such as providing hints and nudges or emailing the manager when those patterns occur.

As a contact center supervisor, you can view triggered utterances, including the frequency of their occurrence, and evaluate how well agents follow the recommended actions within a specific time frame. You can also review speech patterns such as cross talks, dead air, and speech speed to help agents optimize their communication style.

This document is meant for the contact center supervisors and explains everything about the Real-time Agent Coaching feature, including rules, associated triggers, and actions.

## Rules

Rules are a combination of triggers and actions to solve an issue. Each rule is an independent entity that you can edit, delete, tag, untag, enable, or disable. For easy identification, you can label all relevant rules with the same tag. You can use multiple tags for one rule and one tag for multiple rules. Real-time Agent Coaching has two types of rules:

* **Pre-built**: Pre-existing coaching options that come with Agent Coaching.
* **New rules**: New rules you can create based on your requirements.

Currently, the pre-built rules section has two rules – None Intent and Price Objection.

### None Intent

The None Intent rule contains utterances that are used to prevent false positives during intent identification. By using these utterances, you can train the system to differentiate between a positive (trained) and a false-positive (wrong, untrained, ambiguous) utterance. For example, an utterance “I need help with my account” is a positive intent and the system has to act accordingly, but the utterance “It is too expensive” is a false-positive intent wherein the system should not take any action.

This rule is enabled by default, and you can’t disable or delete it. You can, however, add more utterances to make this rule more effective.

#### Adding None Intent Utterances

You can add utterances in two ways:

* **AI Assist**: You can take assistance from AI to generate and add more none intent utterances based on the utterances of your selected rules.
* **Input Utterances Manually**: You can manually enter and save none intent utterances.

##### Steps to add none intent utterances

1. Sign in to **XO Platform**.
2. Click **AgentAssist** > **Experience** > **Agent Coaching**.
3. Click the **edit** button against a **Pre-built, None Intent** rule under **Actions**.

Following this step, you can add multiple utterances.
3. Click **Save**.
    
    The new utterance gets added to the list of utterances.

### Price Objection

This is a predefined rule with conditions and actions that come with Agent Coaching. You can customize the conditions and actions, but can’t edit or delete the rule name. However, you can disable this rule, if needed. It contains a customer’s price objection utterance and defines the actions agents should take in response. The predefined conditions and actions are:

* **Condition (When)**: Price objection utterance by customer
* **Actions (Then do)**:
    * Alert Type: Hint Agent
    * Alert Title: Price Objection identified
    * Alert Body: Please reassure the customer and offer discounts
    * Alert Display: Doesn’t auto close
    * Alert Adherence: “Ok, Got it”
* **Assigned to**: All Agents

The following screenshot displays the **Price Objection** rule:

## Agent Coaching Rule Triggers (When…)
Trigger setting is essential to rule creation. You can’t have a rule without a trigger. Triggers define the conditions for a rule to come into effect. This section explains how to set up triggers for new rules. The available triggers are:

* Utterance Triggers
* Speech Analysis Triggers

### Utterance Triggers
Utterances are inputs from either the customers or the agents. In Utterance Triggers, you set up conditions like input from the customer or agent, the number of times the input came, and the time frame within which the input came to set off the trigger.

#### Steps to set up Utterance Triggers:
1. Go to the rule trigger creation page. For help, refer to [Steps to create a new rule](#steps-to-create-a-new-rule). 
2. Under **When**, click the **+ Add a trigger** button.
3. Select **Utterance**.
4. Click **{select person}**.
5. Select either **Agent** or **Customer**.
6. Click **set utterances**.
7. Enter an utterance that the user (customer or agent) may use in the **Utterances** box.
8. Select the utterance you have entered.
    * There may be other matching utterances the AI suggests:
9. Select the **AI-suggested utterances**, as required.

   !!! note "Note"
       AI suggests utterances that match with what you have entered based on conversation history. It also shows the appearance percentage of utterances.

10. Click **Add**. (The appearance of this button is based on the number of utterances entered by you plus the number of AI-suggested utterances you have selected. In this example, it’s 1+3. So, it’s displayed as Add 4.)

<li>Less than or equal to 60% for 1 Time By Time within 30 seconds: The agent’s speaking time is limited to 60% or less of the conversation time within the first 30 seconds. This might occur when the agent is actively listening to the customer’s initial query or complaint, gathering relevant information, and demonstrating empathy before engaging in a more detailed conversation.

<li>Between 20% and 40% for 1 Time Any Time in Conversation: A balanced conversation, where the agent speaks for a moderate portion of the conversation (20% to 40%) while allowing the customer to express their needs and concerns.

<li>Between 20% and 40% for 4 Times By Time in the first 30 seconds: For four instances within the first 30 seconds, the agent maintains a talk ratio of 20% to 40%, giving the customer ample space to explain their issue or query before responding.

<li>Between 20% and 40% for 1 Time By Time within 30 seconds: The agent maintains a balanced talk ratio (20% to 40%) within the first 30 seconds of the conversation, showing attentiveness and understanding of the customer’s initial statements.

### And/Or Condition
AgentAssist allows you to add multiple rule triggers. It lets you set different conditions like combining multiple rules or choosing one or a set of rules against another or a different set of rules. You can even choose or combine rules from different trigger types like Utterance and Speech Analysis triggers.

#### Steps to select And/Or condition
1. Click **+Add a trigger** in the rule trigger creation page to create a new trigger.
2. Click **+Add a trigger** again to create a new rule trigger.
3. Select **And** or **Or**.
   <img src="../agent-coaching-images/and-or-condition-36.png" alt="and-or-condition" title="and-or-condition" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

!!! note "Note"
    For creating multiple rule triggers, it is mandatory to choose **And** or **Or**. When you choose “And,” the rule triggers add up. When you choose “Or,” the rule triggers set to either of the rules. Here’s an example of this functionality:

The **And** condition ensures that rule triggers **1** and **2** are combined, and the **Or** condition ensures that either the combination of the first two rule triggers (**1+2**) or the third rule trigger (**3**) becomes applicable.

## Agent Real-time Coaching Actions (Then do…)
After setting up rule triggers, you must set up actions for those triggers. Here, you configure what actions AgentAssist should take if the conditions you set up are met. You can set up three different actions:
* Nudge Agent
* Hint Agent
* Email Manager

You can also set up adherence, which is like an acknowledgment, to ensure the agent has followed the instructions.

### Add Adherence
The Add Adherence feature lets you know the agent’s adherence to the instructions in the form of nudges and hints. Later, you can use this acknowledgment to measure agent performance in the Dashboard. This feature is applicable only for the Nudge and Hint Agent actions. 

#### Add Adherence Types
You have two types of adherences to choose from:

* **Acknowledge Pressed**: Choosing this option sends an acknowledgment that the agent understood your instructions. The agent doesn’t need to take any other action except acknowledging your message. An example would be a compliment to the agent for a job well done. The following screenshot is displayed when this option is used:
<img src="../agent-coaching-images/adherence-acknowledge-pressed-38.png" alt="adherence-acknowledge-pressed" title="adherence-acknowledge-presse3d" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;"> 

* **Utterance**: Choosing this option sends an acknowledgment that the agent will take further action within a specified time frame during a session. An example would be when you ask the agent to offer a discount to the customer, and the agent acknowledges that they will perform this action within the next few messages, a few minutes, or anytime during the session. The following screenshot is displayed when this option is selected:
<img src="../agent-coaching-images/adherence-utterance-39.png" alt="adherence-utterance" title="adherence-utterance" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;"> 

For practical examples of this feature, refer to steps 7-8 of [Steps to set up the Nudge Agent actions](#steps-to-set-up-the-nudge-agent-actions).

### Nudge Agent
The Nudge Agent actions are the small messages that pop up on the agent’s screen while communicating with the customers. They are disappearing messages, which stay on the agent’s screen for 5 seconds. The agent can close these messages anytime after their appearance. Through these messages, you either compliment the agents for a good job or direct them to take other appropriate actions to serve the customers in the best way possible. Here are the following four nudges that you can choose from:
* Positive
* Neutral
* Alert
* Critical

#### Steps to set up the Nudge Agent actions:
1. Go to the rule action setup page.
2. Click **+ Add an action** under the **Then do…** section.
