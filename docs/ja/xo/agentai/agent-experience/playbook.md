# AgentAssist Playbook (Beta)


## Overview

Contact center agents are expected to provide the best customer experience despite high call volumes and complex interactions. To empower agents in this endeavor, AgentAssist introduces the Playbook feature—a standard tool offering structured guidance for handling customer interactions.


## Why Playbook?

For effective communication with customers, agents must follow a standard approach of greeting, validating, issue-handling, and closing the conversation. Supervisors may add more to these steps based on other factors. Also, at times, the agents have to follow a situation-specific approach that does not follow the standard structured steps. The Playbook lets supervisors create both standard and situation-specific guidance. On the AgentAssist widget, the standard guidance is always available, but the situation-specific guidance appears only when a configured situation occurs.


## How does the Playbook Help?

The Playbook feature provides agents structured guidance and streamlines task management. Supervisors can define stages and steps to follow, choose step progression (sequential or random), mark whether the steps are completed manually or automatically, and set adherence notifications.

Supervisors can leverage this feature to gain valuable insights into agent adherence to specific playbook steps. They can use this data to enhance agents’ ability to handle interactions and significantly improve customer satisfaction.

This document is a comprehensive guide to the Playbook feature and meant for contact center supervisors.


## Playbook Types

AgentAssist lets you create two types of playbooks:



* **Primary Playbook**: These are standard playbooks that are triggered for all assigned agents. Primary playbooks consist of Open and Close stages, with multiple steps within each stage. The step progression can be either sequential or random. For example, a primary playbook named “Greet the Customer” applies to all assigned agents, requiring them to initiate conversations with a customer greeting as the first step. Subsequent steps, such as validation or issue handling, can follow sequentially or randomly based on the setup.
* **Dynamic Playbook**: These are situation-specific playbooks that trigger based on specific configured scenarios. For example, a playbook named “Competitor Mention” triggers when a competitor is mentioned in a conversation. Dynamic playbooks have a single stage but can have multiple steps within the stage. A lightbulb icon appears on the AgentAssist widget to indicate that an utterance has matched an existing Dynamic playbook. The agent must click the icon to follow the playbook for that specific situation.

## Playbook Configuration

The Playbook Configuration section explains the setup process of a playbook. A playbook has two main categories–Stages and Steps–with Stages as the primary and Steps as the secondary category. By default, Stages are available as Open and Close. There can be multiple steps inside each stage, and you can choose how step progression (sequential or random) takes place.


### Step Configuration

Steps are the secondary categories that reside under Stages. By default, the Primary playbooks have three steps under the Open stage and two steps under the Close stage. You can add more steps based on the requirement.

#### Creating a Step in Primary Playbooks


1. Create a **Primary** playbook. For help, refer to [Steps to create a Primary Playbook](#steps-to-create-a-primary-playbook).
2. Click **+ Add Step**. The **Step Configuration** page appears.
3. Enter a title for the new step in the **Step Title** field.
4. Enter a description of the step in the **Step Body** field.
5. Select the **Enable send**/**copy button,** if you want to send the content of the Step Body field to the customer.

    !!! note

        The Enable send/copy button appears only if the Channel is selected as Voice during playbook creation.

6. Click **Add Buttons** to select the confirmation button.
7. Select **Confirmation**, Yes/No, in the **Buttons** field:
    1. Select **Yes** to indicate a step completion.
    2. Select **No** to indicate an incomplete step.
8. Select the color ring against **Yes** or **No** to change their color.
9. Select the **Delete** button against Yes or No to delete them.
10. Click **Save** to complete the process.


#### Creating a Step in Dynamic Playbooks


1. Create a Dynamic playbook. For help, refer to the [Steps to Create a Dynamic Playbook](#steps-to-create-a-dynamic-playbook) section.
2. Click **+ Add Stage**.
3. Enter a name for the stage.
4. Click the **tick** mark to save the updates.
5. Click **+ Add Step**.
6. For further steps, follow step-3 onwards of the [Creating a Step in Primary Playbooks](#creating-a-step-in-primary-playbooks) section.


### Step Adherence

You can set up how you want to determine an agent’s adherence to a step completion (manual/automatic). For manual setup, skip the Step Adherence section during a playbook creation, and the agent has to manually click the step completion button in the AgentAssist widget. For automatic setup, the system determines step completion based on the input you have set up. This section explains how to set up automatic step adherence.

The system dynamically determines an agent’s step adherence through one of the selected inputs. Available inputs for selection are:



* **By Utterance**: The system determines an agent’s compliance/adherence to a step completion by listening to some specific utterances from the agent or the customer that indicate completion of a step. Utterances can be of two types:
    * Agent Utterance: Agent’s utterances that indicate completion of a step.
    * Customer Utterance: Customer’s utterances that indicate completion of a step.
* **By Dialog Execution**: The system determines an agent’s compliance/adherence to a step by watching a Dialog Task execution run by the agent in the AgentAssist widget.


#### Steps to set up Step Adherence

1. Create a playbook. For help, refer to [Steps to create a Primary Playbook](#steps-to-create-a-primary-playbook).
2. Click **+ Add Step**. The **Step Configuration** page appears.
3. Click the **Step Adherence** button.
4. Select either **By Utterance** or **By Dialog Execution**.
    1. If you select **By Utterance**:
        1. Select **Agent Utterance** or **Customer Utterance**.
        2. Enter an utterance in the **Utterances** field. The AI generates utterances with similar meanings and lists them with the percentages of time that were found in conversation over a certain period.
        3. Select the utterances from the list, as required.
        4. Click **Apply**.
    2. If you select **By Dialog Execution**:
        5. Select an option from the **Automation** list. This list displays Dialog tasks specific to the selected channel in the playbook.
        6. Select an option under the **Wait for Dialog Execution for…** section.
            1. **Initiated**: Select **Initiated** to indicate step completion once the Dialog task is initiated.
            2. **Completed**: Select **Completed** to indicate step completion once the Dialog task is completed.
