# Multiple Phone Numbers Support in the WhatsApp Channel

The platform now supports virtual assistant responses via WhatsApp to the incoming messages for **Infobip** from multiple phone numbers. The virtual assistant responds only to all the relevant source phone numbers rather than a universal number.

    The user can add a **maximum of 20 phone numbers** to the list after which the Phone Number input field is disabled.

## Responding to an Incoming Number

The Kore.ai XO Platform validates the incoming number by checking if itâ€™s present in the configured list. Only when present will the platform respond and deliver the message. Otherwise, the platform fails to deliver the message to Infobip, triggers an exception, and logs the information under the **NLP Insights** > **Debug Log** section.
