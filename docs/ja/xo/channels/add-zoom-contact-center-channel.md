# Adding the Zoom Contact Center Channel

**Zoom Contact Center (ZCC)** is an automation solution for enterprises to manage customer interactions across voice and chat channels. It enables chat automation through Asynchronous Webhook Integration. The **Kore.ai XO Platform** now supports the Zoom Contact Center channel to integrate virtual assistants for rich and asynchronous messaging experiences.

This integration streamlines customer support, automates responses, and improves overall operational efficiency, leading to enhanced customer experiences and increased productivity.


## How it Works

Here’s a general overview of how virtual assistant interactions work on the Zoom Contact Center Channel:

* **Setup and Configuration**: Kore.ai sets up and configures the integration between their virtual assistant and ZCC. This involves installing specific connectors provided by Zoom and configuring the settings to establish a connection.
* **Channel Integration**: Once the integration is set up, the virtual assistants on the XO Platform can be configured to use ZCC as one of its communication channels. This means that incoming customer inquiries can be handled through Zoom’s communication platform, which may include voice calls and chat messages.
* **Routing and Distribution**: When a customer initiates contact through ZCC, the XO Platform’s routing system directs the interaction to an available agent based on predefined rules and criteria.
* **Agent Interaction**: The agent receives the customer interaction and responds to the customer using ZCC’s communication features, such as answering voice calls or chat messages.


## Prerequisites

Please ensure you have the following before enabling this channel:



1. A Zoom App Marketplace Developer account. _Don’t have an account? Sign up [here](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)._
2. Developer access to the XO Platform. _Need Developer Access? [Contact us](https://kore.ai/contact-us/)._


## Setting up Zoom Contact Center

The important steps to set up the ZCC channel are summarized below:


1. [Associate an App to the channel](#step-1-associate-an-app).
2. [Create a Bot Connector instance](#step-2-add-koreai-chatbot-connector-instance) on [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps) to associate a virtual assistant.
3. [Authorize the connector by configuring the required parameters](#step-3-authorize-the-connector).
4. [Enable the channel on the XO Platform](#step-4-enable-the-channel).


### Step 1: Associate an App

As a first step to enable the channel, associate an app on the XO Platform by selecting an app from the list or creating a new one.

To create an app, follow the steps below:


1. Navigate to **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All**.
2. Select **Zoom Contact Center**.
3. Click the **Configurations** tab.
4. If you’re creating an app for the first time, click the **Create App** link. Otherwise, select **Create App** from the dropdown list or click **Add**.

5. In the **Create New Client App** window, follow the steps below:
    * In the **Name** field, enter the name for the app registration used in Bot Builder,. For example, My App Registration.
    * Select one of these scopes for the app:
        * **Allow anonymous users to chat with the bot**: Enables anonymous users to interact with the bot.
        * **Auto register new users on XO Platform**: Select to control the auto-user registration in Kore.ai if the user assertion is unknown.
    * In the **JWT Signing** **Algorithms Used For Client App Authentication** drop-down list, select one of the following security algorithms:
        * **RS256/RS512**: Select to enable the **Public Key**. _The Private key, used for encryption, is provided by the user, and the Public key, used for decryption, is provided by the Platform_. Both the keys have to be used for generating the token. The Public Key is used by the XO Platform to authenticate the client application.
        * **HS256/HS512**: Select to generate a **Secret Key** and a **Client ID**. The **Client ID** is required for app initialization, and the **Secret Key** is used by the XO Platform to authenticate the client application.
    * (Optional) In the **Push Notifications** section, click **Enable** and then specify a URL to send the notifications.

    * When you Enable the Push Notifications, you can select one of the following options to manage the notifications:
        * **All Messages** – Sends push notifications for all conversation messages to the client app.
        * **Message Delivery Failures** – Sends push notifications for failure scenarios such as WebSocket Disconnected, App is Killed, and Message Delivery Failure.
        <img src="../images/Zoom2.png" alt="message delivery failure" title="message delivery failure" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">


    * To customize the display messages for the push notifications messages sent to the client app, select one of the following options:
        * **Send Original Messages** – Sends the actual conversation message as part of the push notification.
        * **Show a standard message from standard responses** – Sends a generic message instead of the original message.
        <img src="../images/Zoom3.png" alt="show standard messages" title="show standard messages" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">


    * Click **Manage Responses** to add custom messages in the push notification. To learn more about adding responses, read articles [Default Standard Responses](../automation/intelligence/conversation-management/standard-responses.md) and [Default Conversations](../automation/intelligence/conversation-management/default-conversations.md).
    * Click **Save** and then, click **Create**.
