# Adding the Skype Channel

To add the Skype channel to your bot, you need a developer _Microsoft Bot Framework_ account to configure the connection between Skype and Kore.ai. Adding the Skype channel to your Kore.ai bot is a three-step process to allow end-users to interact with your bot. To add the Skype channel to your bot, follow the below steps:



1. **Register the Bot** – In your _Microsoft Bot Framework_ developer account, you must register the bot by adding all the bot details and creating the **App ID** and **Password**. To register the bot, you must have created and registered for a free account in the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) developer portal.
2. **Enable Channel** – After registering the bot, you must enable the channel.
3. **Publish Channel** – After the channel is enabled and all configurations are verified, you must publish the bot to make it available for developers.
