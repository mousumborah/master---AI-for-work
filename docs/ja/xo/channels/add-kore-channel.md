# Adding the Kore.ai Channel

Adding the Kore.ai channel to your assistant allows end-users to interact with it using the Kore.ai Messaging application available as a web, desktop, or mobile client.

To add the Kore.ai channel, follow the below steps:


1. Select the assistant that you want to add the Kore.ai Messaging channel to.
2. Navigate to **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All** >, click the **Kore.ai** icon. The **Kore.ai Channel** page is displayed.
3. Under the **Enable/Disable Channel** section, select **Enable**
4. Enable **Bot Commands** to be used within Kore.ai Messenger Rooms. Provide a **Command Name,** add **Help** text, give an **Example Command** and enter a **Description**.
5. Click **Save** to enable the channel.

After enabling the channel and verifying all the configurations, you can optionally publish the assistant for the new channel. Learn more about[ Publishing your Virtual Assistant](../deploy/publishing-bot.md).
