# Adding the Cisco Jabber Channel

Cisco Jabber is a platform that offers multiple communication methods, and which you can integrate with the assistants built with the Kore.ai XO Platform. Adding the Jabber channel to your Kore.ai VA allows end-users to interact with it using their _Jabber_ accounts. This article shows you how to add it as a Channel, where your VA can communicate to end-users via Jabber. You must have or register for a developer account in the _Jabber_ portal.


## Configuration

To add the Cisco Jabber channel, follow the below steps:



1. Select the assistant that you want to add the Jabber channel to.
2. Go to **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All**.
3. Click the **Jabber** icon. The **Jabber Channel page** is displayed.
4. To enable a webhook integration on your Jabber application, log into your Jabber app. Copy the **Webhook URL** from the **Configurations** tab on the Jabber channel page and enter the **Webhook URL** field in the Jabber app for integration.
5. Go to the **Configurations** tab on the Jabber channel page to complete the channel setup.
6. Capture the **POST URL** details from your Jabber app and enter them in the **POST URL** field.
7. You can also optionally generate and capture the **Access Token** details from your Jabber integration and enter in the **Access Token field** to enable secure communication between Jabber and the VA.
8. Select **Yes** and click **Save** to enable Jabber Channel.

After enabling the channel and verifying all the configurations, you can optionally publish the assistant for the new channel. Learn more about[ Publishing your Virtual Assistant](../deploy/publishing-bot.md).
