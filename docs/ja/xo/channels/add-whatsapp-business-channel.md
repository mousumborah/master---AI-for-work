        * **Phone Number** – Copy and paste the number displayed on the **Infobip** portal for your account under the **Connect** section (please refer to step 3). The Platform now supports **adding multiple phone numbers on the WhatsApp Messaging Channel** for the same Virtual Assistant. The Virtual Assistant responds to only the source number from which it receives the message rather than a common phone number. [Learn more](whatsapp-support-for-multiple-phone-numbers.md).
        * **Base URL**: Copy the Base URL from this page. This URL will be used on Kore.ai to send the messages when the **WhatsApp Business Messaging** channel is enabled.
        <img src="../images/whatsapp7.png" alt="infobib messaging partner" title="infobib messaging partner" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">


        * **Username and Password**: The username and password of the **Infobip** account holder. Infobip’s API requires authentication and uses the basic authorization for sending and receiving messages over the API with these values.
        * **Webhook URL**: Copy the webhook URL provided in the configuration tab and update the same on the **Infobip developer portal** for Infobip to send the received messages from the subscriber (WhatsApp Business Messaging).
        <img src="../images/whatsapp8.png" alt="infobib API" title="infobib API" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

    * Select **Yes** to enable the **WhatsApp Business Messaging** channel.
    * Click **Save** to complete the integration setup.
    <img src="../images/whatsapp9.png" alt="save infobib configuration" title="save infobib configuration" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

    !!! note

          If you’re using the development sandbox on **Infobip**, once the channel is enabled and published, you will need to send messages in the format “**_[Keyword on infobip]_** **(User input)**” For example, “Kore Hi”.



### Viewing WhatsApp Message Logs on Infobip

Once you’ve sent a message to **Infobip** using the **WhatsApp Business Messaging** channel, you can track the text, Virtual Assistant responses, delivery status, and errors (if any) on your **Infobip** account under **Channels and Numbers** > **Channel Essentials** > **WhatsApp** > **Overview** > **View Logs**.

<img src="../images/whatsapp11.png" alt="infobib errors" title="infobib errors" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">




### Messaging Templates

WhatsApp for business communications supports the following messaging types for the Infobip channel:



* **Templates**: Formatted, non-editable, and pre-registered messages approved by WhatsApp.
* **Free-Form texts**: Free-flowing text messages.

The Kore.ai XO Platform now supports public APIs for WhatsApp templates on the Infobip channel. These templates can be used during virtual assistant conversations to structure the messages exchanged. Since global UI/rich template formats are not supported, the bot designer should register the required templates with Infobip and get them approved.

The Platform automatically decides the payload to be sent to the channels after parsing Advanced Messages (JS) that include one of the following:



* **String**: A free-form text message template is used if the JS result is a string.
* **Object**: A message template is used if the JS result is an object.

**Additional Information**

## Adding the WhatsApp Channel Using GupShup Application

The Platform supports integration with **GupShup** to enable WhatsApp business as a channel. In this integration, the platform provides a Webhook URL to be called by GupShup during a conversation to enable events and exchange messages.

!!! note

      To enable WhatsApp Messaging on this channel, you must have a GupShup enterprise account.

The important steps in completing this channel enablement are as follows:

### Step 2b: Set up the WABA Parameters on the Platform

To integrate your GupShup service using the WBM channel to the Kore.ai XO Platform, follow the steps below:



1. Copy the **Mobile number**, **WABA ID**, and the **Password** from the GupShup WhatsApp Dashboard.
2. On the Kore.ai Bot Builder, navigate to **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All** > **WhatsApp Business Messaging**.
3. Click the **Configurations** tab on the **WhatsApp Business Messaging** window.
4. Select **GupShup** from the dropdown list for **Messaging Partner**.
5. Paste the copied values for **Mobile number**, **WABA ID**, and **Password** in the respective input fields.  <img src="../images/whatsapp19.png" alt="add gupshup WABA ID" title="add gupshup WABA ID" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">



### Step 2c: Configure the Callback URL/Webhook URL

3. Ensure you have selected **GupShup** for the **Messaging Partner** field. Click **Copy** to copy the **Webhook URL**.  <img src="../images/whatsapp20.png" alt="enter gupshup webhook" title="enter gupshup webhook" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

4. Navigate to your **GupShup WhatsApp Dashboard**.
5. Click the **Settings** icon for your app of type **Access API**.
<img src="../images/whatsapp21.png" alt="enter gupshup settings" title="enter gupshup settings" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

6. On the **Settings** page, scroll down to the **Test Access API and set callback URL** section.
7. Click the **Callback URL / Link your Bot** tab.
8. Turn on the toggle switch and paste the **Webhook URL** you copied from the Bot Builder in the **Enter your Callback URL** input field.
<img src="../images/whatsapp22.png" alt="test gupshup api" title="test gupshup api" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

9. Click **Set**.

    Refer to this [link](https://www.gupshup.io/developer/docs/bot-platform/guide/whatsapp-api-documentation#setupcallbackURL) for more information on setting up the Callback/Webhook URL on the Gupshup Dashboard.

    !!! note

          Contact the Gupshup customer support team to help configure the Kore.ai webhook URL on GupShup and enable inbound messages to the bot.


10. Once the callback is set successfully on the Kore.ai XO Platform **WhatsApp Business Messaging** window, follow the steps below:
    * (Optional) Enable the **Associate an App** option, if required, and follow the configuration steps.
    * Select **YES** for the **Enable Channel** option.
    * Click **Save**.


### Step 3: Secure the Integration

The Webhook URL used on the WhatsApp Business Messaging Channel for GupShup is a public URL that may cause security vulnerabilities. The Kore.ai XO Platform enforces an authentication mechanism by securing the webhook URL and associating it with a Kore.ai App. The **Associate an App** feature is used for this purpose.

This feature is available under **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All** > **WhatsApp Business Messaging** > **Configurations**.

<img src="../images/whatsapp23.png" alt="secure gupshup integration" title="secure gupshup integration" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">


**How it Works**

When **Associate an App** is enabled, the following happens:



1. The URL is called by **GupShup** (the Callback URL you configure under Settings) where the channel passes the authorization token as the header information.
2. The Platform checks for the JWT Token of the associated app in the Header and accepts the Webhook API call(s).
3. However, if the Token is missing, the Platform rejects the incoming API call(s) and responds with an error code.

Once you enable **Associate an App**, you must manually select an app and configure it for the GupShup app (by clicking **Copy** and pasting the _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ (shown above) from the Kore.ai XO Platform).

!!! note

    This channel configuration is not a part of the Bot Import/Export feature. The user should manually enable the channel for the target Bot. The integration flow remains the same even with the **App Association** feature.


### Messaging Templates

As part of the GupShup WhatsApp channel integration, the Platform supports the following Gupshup outbound message types to provide an engaging, interactive end-user experience:



* **Templates:** WhatsApp-approved, pre-formatted messages that are not editable.
* **Free-flowing**: Messages that support all media types are known as “free-form.”

You may have to switch between these message types depending on the timing and initiation of the chat.

Whether you are messaging clients inside the messaging window determines the type of message you send. When messaging customers outside of this window, you must follow pre-approved message template rules. [Learn more](https://docs.gupshup.io/docs/message-types-templates#message-templates).

Message templates for outbound messages play a crucial role in ensuring businesses adhere to WhatsApp policies when initiating communications. These templates come preformatted with predefined text, providing a structured framework for messages sent to end users. Their reusability is particularly valuable when sending the same message multiple times.

Instead of transmitting the actual message content, the template name serves as the identifier for the message content when sending a message template.

Templates can incorporate placeholders, allowing for the inclusion of values or customized information before sending the template message. Additionally, template headers may include media that provides more detailed information. Introducing buttons to messages further enhances interactivity and engagement.

Message templates typically consist of Header, Body, Footer, and Buttons. For detailed see [Gupshup docs](https://docs.gupshup.io/docs/whatsapp-message-types-outbound-templates#header)

The Document with Text template is also supported for outbound messages. With this template, developers can send a document along with informative text for end users to download.

A sample template script is given below:

'''
    var msg = {

    "type": "document",

    "message_text":"This is document caption",

    "caption":"This document talks about Gupshup features",

    "filename": "Developer.pdf",

    "document": {"url":"http://enterprise.smsgupshup.com/help/in/EnterpriseAPIDocument.pdf"}

    };

    print(JSON.stringify(msg))

'''

Prior to submitting notifications through the WhatsApp Business Solution or the WhatsApp Cloud Business Solution, it is imperative to create and register your message templates. This step ensures that the templates comply with WhatsApp’s review requirements, facilitating effective communication within the platform.

The Kore.ai XO Platform supports public APIs for the integration and utilization of WhatsApp Outbound Templates on the GupShup channel. Contact(https://kore.ai/contact-us/) our experts to learn more. 

### Support for WhatsApp Pay

The XO Platform supports WhatsApp Pay, a digital payment service that enables instant money transfers between banks through mobile devices using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) system for the GupShup channel. GupShup, as a WhatsApp Business integration provider, supports outbound message types **Order Details [Text]** and **Order Status** templates, which are also supported on the XO Platform via APIs.

**How it Works**



1. When the end user completes the transaction using the WhatsApp Pay template rendered on the WhatsApp channel, the Platform receives an inbound message.
2. The Inbound message is in the form of a JSON Object containing payment details and their respective status.
3. The Platform automatically decides the payload to be sent to the channels after parsing Advanced Messages (JS) that include one of the following:
    * **String**: A free-form text message template is used if the JS result is a string.
    * **Object**: A message template is used if the JS result is an object.
4. The Platform accepts this JSON object format as the **Composite** entity type and stores it in the context object under the respective entity.

An example of a success payload is given below:


```
 {
   "waNumber": "919XXXXXXXX3",
   "mobile": "919XXXXXXXX",
  "interactive": "{\"payment\":{\"transaction_id\":\"31706099xxxx\",\"reference_id\":\"fastag091-12xx\",\"total_amount\":{\"offset\":100,\"value\":300},\"currency\":\"INR\",\"transaction_type\":\"upi\",\"status\":\"success\"},\"type\":\"payment\"}",
  "name": "ɹɐʞsxxxxx sxxxxxɹɥS",
  "type": "interactive",
  "timestamp": "1687160320000"
}
```
### Error Response Codes

The table below outlines the various error status codes that may occur when receiving incoming requests through the Gupshup Whatsapp channel:
