# Feedback Dashboard

Once you’ve created a **Feedback Survey** for your conversations based on a survey type (_NPS_, _CSAT_, or _Like/Dislike_), it’s important to constantly monitor and analyze the customer responses, feedback survey scores, and trends over a given period.

Thus, knowing the survey type scores and the key metrics for respondents, responses, trends, and users helps gain actionable insights into the customer experience your business is delivering. The new **Feedback Analytics Dashboard** provides prebuilt dashboards to view the survey results and insights based on the duration, survey name, and type you select.

This dashboard displays graphs and charts derived from real-time feedback data for the following:



* Distribution trends of feedback scores.
* The overall score for the given period and its trend.
* The comprehensive feedback results with an option to export the results for review.

!!! note

    The **Feedback Dashboard** is available in Release 10.0.0 (January 2023).



**To view the Feedback dashboard, follow the steps**: 

1. Click the three dots on the left navigation pane and then click **Analytics**. The **Analytics** panel is displayed with the list of reports.
