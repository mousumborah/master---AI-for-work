# Conversations History

The **Conversation History** dashboard allows you to review the transcripts of past conversations and label certain conversations for follow-up or further action.

The **Advanced Conversation Analytics** feature provides a more detailed view of the conversation, including events and custom tags, which can help you better understand the interaction between the customer and the virtual assistant. Custom Tags can be reused across conversations for training purposes and for identifying areas where the virtual assistant could improve.

!!! note

    The **Conversations History** Dashboard is available only post the 9.3 release, i.e. post-July 24, 2022.


**To view the Conversations History dashboard, follow the steps**:

### Prebuilt Filters for Conversations History

As an analyst, you may need a customized view of the conversation’s history data based on specific conditional filters. This helps analyze conversations based on priority/criticality.

The Platform now supports **Prebuilt Filters** or **Presets** for the most common use-case scenarios. Presets reduce the developer’s efforts in skimming through each conversation to understand and tag them for a specific use case.

**How it works**

1. The system checks the configuration parameters and the filter conditions for a conversation session.
2. The conversation session is mapped to the respective filter automatically.
3. Based on the date range selected on the **Conversations History** Dashboard, the system fetches and displays the conversations that meet the Prebuilt Filters’ criteria.


### Types of Prebuilt Filters

The following table displays each preset’s filter name, predefined configuration parameters, and description. For more information on the configuration parameters, please click here.

### Feedback Prebuilt Filter

The Platform supports the **Feedback** filter on the **Filter Views** panel to create custom feedback filters. Based on the filter criteria, the system groups and displays the conversations for the following parameters:

* **Feedback Survey Template Type**: Indicates if the selected type is **_NPS_**, **_CSAT_**, or **_Thumbs-up / Thumbs-down_**. Learn more.
* **Operator**: The conditional/logical operator that applies to the Feedback filter evaluation which includes one of the following:
    * Equals to
    * Less than or equals to
    * Greater than equals to

!!! note

    The **Trace ID** is retained in the logs for 30 days. Once the **Trace ID** is expired, you see a tooltip message as ‘`Trace Id: Trace records for this message are not available`.

### Define Alternate Text for JavaScript Messages

The Platform uses the`{} JavaScript` tag in the Chat History for bot messages and templates written using JavaScript. However, bot designers can now add a context-specific **Alternate Text** to JavaScript messages/templates they define and explain the purpose more clearly. The added Alternate Text is displayed alongside the JavaScript message tag in the **Chat History** window for developers to get a better understanding of the message’s intent. 

The <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/apis/automation/conversation-history/" target="_blank">Conversation History API</a> response includes a parameter `messages.tags.altText` which captures the **Alternate Text** value(s) configured in the JavaScript message or Web SDK template payload through the predefined function discussed below.

**How It Works**

1. Developer uses a predefined function in the syntax `tags.addAlternateText("value")` to add the Alternative Text to a JavaScript message or Web SDK template on any channel, including a Webhook.
2. The Alternate text indicating the JavaScript message/template’s purpose should be provided for the `value` parameter. For example, `tags.addAlternateText("Accounts Selection Message")`.

**Usage Example**

For a bank account creation task, the Platform renders a template in the end channel to prompt the user for account type selection. This requires the developer to define a JavaScript message specific to the channel.

The developer can generate an Alternate text like “_Accounts Selection Message_,” in the template code to indicate that the JavaScript message is for account type selection.

After the end user selects an account type, the Alternate message appears in the Chat History above the `{} JavaScript` tag.

**Important Considerations**

* You can define static and dynamic values for the alternate text.
* Alternate text can be defined for JavaScript messages in user prompts, error prompts, Small Talk, standard responses, FAQs, and events.
* The Platform assigns the latest to a message when you add multiple Alternate text values.
* In the **Chat History** window, the Platform substitutes the payload label with an alternative text tag for all channel templates, excluding the SDK Template.

### Message Tags

**Message Tags** help identify and categorize messages in the chat transcript. They add clarity and context to the conversation and can be reused across related conversations. System-defined message tags are provided by default, but users can create custom tags by defining a **key-value pair**. The key is used as an identifier for the specific message, and the value is the expected customer response to that message.

!!! IMPORTANT

* You cannot add the same key to a message again.
* A custom message tag can only be added and detached from a message and not edited.


**To add a custom message tag, follow the steps**:

1. Hover over the message transcript in the conversation where you wish to add the message tag.
2. Click **+Message Tag**.

3. In the **Add Message Tag** window, enter the **Key** and **Value** in their respective text fields.

4. Click **Save**. The new message tag is displayed below the message in the transcript slider.

!!! note

    The custom message tag you create is available in the **Custom Tags Filters** section as one of the filtering criteria.


The **Feedback Survey** feature allows customers to provide feedback on their conversations with the virtual assistant.

If enabled, the customer’s response to the survey will be displayed in the chat transcript under **Chat History**.

The system captures and displays a **feedback event label** `"End of Conversation: Survey Type"` on the chat transcript, indicating the end of the conversation and the survey type.

The response will be mapped to a **key-value** pair for the conversation timeline, which can be useful for analyzing the conversation and customer experience at a granular level. This information is useful to improve the virtual assistant’s performance and enhance the customer experience.

The **Conversation Summary** displays the following information on the Feedback event:

1. The **Start Time** and **End Time**, along with the real-time counts for the following:
    1. User Messages
    2. Bot Messages
    3. Intents Identified
    4. Intents Unidentified
    5. Tasks Completed
    6. Failed Tasks

2. The Feedback Event is based on the event timeline with **Key** and **Value**.
3. The **total number of feedback responses** collected for the session and the following:
    * Type of Feedback
