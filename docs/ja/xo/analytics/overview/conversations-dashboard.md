# Conversations Dashboard
The Conversations Dashboard provides insights into how conversations are handled by your virtual assistant (VA). It shows how many conversations were successfully answered by the VA, how many were transferred to agents, and how many were incomplete. You can also view other metrics, such as the trend of conversation sessions, the conversation path analysis, the session distribution by channel, and the VA’s engagement grouped by self-service, drop-off, and agent transfer sessions.

!!! note

    The Conversations Dashboard is available only post 9.2 release, i.e. post April 09, 2022.

**To view the Conversations dashboard, follow the steps**:


1. Click the three dots on the left navigation pane and then click **Analytics**. The Analytics panel is displayed with the list of reports.
2. Click **Conversations Dashboard** under the **Automation** section of the **Analytics** panel. The Overview dashboard is displayed on the right side of the page.
3. Select appropriate filters on the dashboard and click **Apply**.

The Conversations Dashboard is organized into four categories based on the conversation behavior, explained below.


## Conversation Sessions

Conversation Sessions display the total number of conversations between the virtual assistant and a user in a specific period of time. The session starts when a user sends a message and ends when the user indicates that the problem is solved, abandons the chat, or reaches the agent transfer node. For details on the metrics used in each widget/category, see the [Metrics Table](#metrics-table) section in this document.

## Self-service Rate

Self-service sessions refer to the conversations that the virtual assistant contains. The **Self-service Rate** widget displays the percentage and total number of self-service conversations. It also shows the percentage increase or decrease in the self-service conversations from the last selected period. For example, if you select the past 24 hours’ data, the widget displays the percentage and total conversation sessions contained in the past 24 hours. Based on your selection, the widget can also display the rise or drop in the percentage of conversation sessions from the previous 24 hours. Any ongoing conversation is classified under Self-service conversation.

If a dialog task reaches the <em>End Of Dialog</em> node, the task is considered as completed and categorized as a self-service. There could be a scenario where a virtual assistant is configured with either a <em>Welcome event</em> or an <em>On-Connect event</em>, and there are multiple messages sent by the virtual assistant without any user interaction. In this case, the platform considers this task as contained and increases the self-service count. For details on the metrics used in each widget/category, see the [Metrics Table](#metrics-table) section in this document.

## Drop-off Rate

A drop-off is a conversation session where the user abandons the conversation without completing the task. Below are a few scenarios where the conversations can lead to a drop-off:

* A user left the conversation midway without completing any task.
* The task ended as a failure.
* The last interaction/message resulted in an ‘intent not identified’ scenario.
* No response from the assistant.
* The user abandons the assistant during a live conversation.

The **Drop-off Rate** widget displays the percentage and the total number of drop-offs within a selected period. It also shows the percentage increase or decrease in the drop-off sessions from the last selected period. For details on the metrics used in each widget/category, see the [Metrics Table](./conversations-dashboard.md#metrics-table) section in this document.

## Agent Transfer Rate

Some conversations may require human assistance as the users can’t finish the tasks using the virtual assistant. In such cases, the session is handed over to a human agent for help. When the conversation reaches the point where it’s transferred to an agent – the dialog reaches the agent transfer node, the platform considers this as an Agent Transfer session.

The **Agent Transfer Rate** widget displays the percentage and total number of agent transfers within the selected period. It also shows the percentage increase or decrease in the agent transfer sessions from the last selected period. For details on the metrics used in each widget/category, see the [Metrics Table](#metrics-table) section in this document.as

!!! note

    Unblu and IVR channels don’t need any Agent Transfer node to transfer the conversation to Agents.


## Metrics Table

Refer to the table below for the list of widgets present across each category on the Conversations Dashboard.

!!! note

    For a trend line chart, if the period is 24 hours, the X-axis shows hourly intervals. Otherwise, the axis shows daily intervals. The Y-axis shows the total number of sessions.

Conversation Length (for ongoing conversations) = Dashboard Load timestamp – Conversation Start timestamp.
