While generating reports, you have two options - Run On Demand and Schedule.

**Run On Demand**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the report's schedule can be set to run on demand.

**Schedule**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the report's schedule can be changed. The use of the schedule is the standard way to generate a report. If the report is scheduled for later, then it will automatically be generated on the scheduled day and time without the need to click Run.

10. Click the **PDF/Page** icon and generate the output of that report, as shown below.
