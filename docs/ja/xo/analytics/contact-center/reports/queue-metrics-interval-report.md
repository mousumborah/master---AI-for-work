2. In the list of reports, choose the Queue Metrics Interval Report.
3. Enter the **Report Name** and **Report Description**.
4. Select the **Time Period**.
5. Select the **Data Filters**.
6. Select Report Generation and choose from the following options:
    1. Schedule
        1. Run On Demand
        2. Schedule
    2. Select Format

    While generating reports, you have two options – Run On Demand and Schedule.

    **Run On Demand**: While creating a new report or editing an existing one, the report’s schedule can be run on demand.

    **Schedule**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the report’s schedule can be changed. The use of the schedule is the standard way to generate a report. If the report is scheduled for later, then it will automatically be generated on the scheduled day and time without the need to click Run.

10. Click the CSV icon and generate the output of that report, as shown below.
