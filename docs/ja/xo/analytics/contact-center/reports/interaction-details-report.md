# Interaction Details Report

## Generating the Interaction Details Report

Interaction Details Report is a comprehensive report covering how all interactions were processed, by whom, and their final dispositions. This report contains the meta-data of each conversation, except the recording or transcript. A comma-separated list of all Disposition Codes assigned to that conversation is included in the CSV output file of the Interaction Details Report.

Steps to generate the Interaction Details Report:

1. On the Reports tab, click **New Report**.
2. In the list of reports, choose the Interaction Details report.
3. Enter the **Report Name** and **Report Description**.
4. Select a **Time Period**.
5. Select **Data Filters**.
6. Select Report Generation and choose from the following options:
    * Schedule
        * Run On Demand
        * Schedule
    * Select Format
        * PDF
        * CSV
    * Send To (single email address or a mailing list)
7. Click **Create**.

While generating reports you have two options, Run On Demand and Schedule.

**Run On Demand**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the schedule of the report can be set to run on demand.

**Schedule**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the schedule of the report can be changed. The use of the schedule is the standard way to generate a report. If the report is scheduled for later then it will automatically be generated on the scheduled day and time without the need to click Run.

10. Click the **PDF/Page** icon to generate the output of that report.
