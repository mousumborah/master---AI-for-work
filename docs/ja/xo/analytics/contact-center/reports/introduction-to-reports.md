# Introduction to Reports

Contact Center AI reports enable you to assess the performance of your contact center. These reports ensure the alignment of agents with organizational goals and objectives and provide detailed information on calls, queues, and individual agent performance metrics such as average handle time.

With Contact Center AI, a supervisor can monitor queues, calls, daily tasks, and agent performance metrics via the REPORTS tab of the interface. To access the reports, click the REPORTS tab. A list of available reports is displayed to evaluate agent productivity, efficiency, and time saved through automation.

You can segregate the reports as follows:

**MY REPORTS**: Displays only the reports created by the current user.

**ALL REPORTS**: Displays all the reports.

**FAVORITES**: Displays reports created by any user and marked as favorites by the current user.

Accessibility is of paramount importance as it ensures that critical information is safeguarded and available only to required stakeholders.

You can restrict the accessibility of the reports as required. There are two permissions available:
