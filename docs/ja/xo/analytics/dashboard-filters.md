# Dashboard Filters

The dashboard filters are used to filter and view the analytics data for virtual assistants (VAs) on the following dashboards in the **ANALYTICS** section based on the user’s selection(s):

* Summary Dashboard
* Conversations Dashboard
* Users Dashboard
* Performance Dashboard
* NLP Insights
* Conversation Insights
* Conversations History
* Conversation Flows
* Task Execution Logs
* Feedback Dashboard

To understand the filter criteria availability on different dashboards, see the Filter Criteria Matrix.

!!! note

    By default, the VA dashboard displays data for the past 24 hours.

## Filter Criteria Descriptions

The following table describes all the filter criteria available on the Kore.ai XO platform:

<li><strong>7 Days</strong> – Data aggregated over the past seven days is displayed. The start date is the day you select from which this filter is applied. By default, the current day is set as the start date, which you can change.

<ul>

<li><strong>User Level</strong>: These tags can be added to the user information.

<li><strong>Message Level</strong>: These tags can be added to the message of the current node. If the current node is not associated with a message, then the tag gets added to the immediate previous node that has a message associated with it.

<li><strong>Session Level</strong>: These tags can be added at the current session of the user.

<p>
You can set the criterion as either <strong><em>Contain</em></strong> or <strong><em>Does Not Contain </em></strong>the specified value.
<p>
This criterion is <strong>not available for the Debug Logs tab</strong> of NLP Insights.
<p>
You can define Tags as key-value pairs from Script written anywhere in the application like Script node, Message, Entity, Confirmation prompts, Error prompts, Knowledge Graph responses, BotKit SDK, etc.
<p>
The following script can be used for adding meta tags:
<ul>

<li>To add a User level tag: \
tags.addUserLevelTag(“tagname”,”tagvalue”)

<li>To add a Session level tag: \
tags.addSessionLevelTag(“tagname”,”tagvalue”)

<li>To add the Message level tag: \
tags.addMessageLevelTag(“tagname”,”tagvalue”)
</li>
