# LLM and Generative AI Usage Logs



The LLM and Gen AI Usage Logs on the XO Platform provide detailed information about requests sent to LLMs and the corresponding responses. The logs include data on features accessing the LLMs, response generation time, payload details, tokens used, and more. It enables bot designers to track and compare usage across various LLM features and refine prompts and settings to boost performance and user experience.

The log analysis focuses on the following key areas:



* **Request-response dynamics**: Analysis of request-response dynamics between user prompts and model responses offers insights into prompt and model performance in specific scenarios.
* **Payload details**: Analyzing the payload data exchanged during interactions allows for effective monitoring and optimization of advanced AI functionalities.

To access the logs, Go to **Analytics** > **Gen AI Analytics** > **Usage Logs**. Click any record to view the log summary and payload details.
