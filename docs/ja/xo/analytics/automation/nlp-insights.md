# NLP Insights

The NLP Insights feature helps you gain in-depth insights into the analytics data and assess your virtual assistant’s performance in identifying and executing tasks. You can improve your VA’s performance based on the insights. 

**To view the NLP Insights dashboard, follow the steps**: 


1. Click the three dots on the left navigation pane and then click **Analytics**. The **Analytics** panel is displayed with the list of reports.
<img src="../images/navigating-to-nlp.png" alt="Navigating to NLP" title="Navigating to NLP" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;"> 

2. Click the **NLP Insights** under the **Automation** section of the **Analytics** panel. The **NLP Insights dashboard** is displayed on the right side of the page.
3. Select appropriate filters on the dashboard and click **Apply**.

The **NLP Insights** page shows the specific information in the following sections:



* Intent Found: Number of identified intents
* Intent Not Found: Number of unidentified intents
* Unhandled Utterances: Number of unhandled utterances
* Pinned: Pinned NLP Insight records. Specific records are pinned to highlight them for easy access and viewing.

In the latest version of the XO Platform, the **NLP Insights** section retains only the NLP-related analytics data for task identification. The new Task Execution Logs section displays the analytics data related to a VA’s task execution.


## NLP Analytics Fields

The following fields are available for NLP Analytics:


### Intent Found

An intent refers to the goal the customer has in mind when typing in a question or comment. The  phrases used to express the intent are called user utterances. The Intent Found tab includes all the user utterances identified by the platform. 

!!! note

    You need to check for false positives in scenarios where the utterance is wrongly identified for an intent.


See the following table and features section to know more:

   <img src="../images/intent-found-1.png" alt="Intent Found" title="Intent Found" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

The following is an example of Intent Found:

_User: I want to know my order confirmation_

_VA: Would you like to switch to Track Order_

_User: Yes_

_VA: Let’s log you in. \
      How would you like to go ahead – Log in or Guest?_

In the above conversation, the user utterance of _‘knowing the order confirmation status’_ is recognized by the VA and successfully mapped to the Track Order intent.

**Description of the Intent Found Fields**

The following table lists the fields on the Intent Fount tab with descriptions:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>FIELDS</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>

   <td>Date & Time
   </td>
   <td>The date and time of the chat. You can sort the data by either <strong>Newest to Oldest </strong>or <strong>Oldest to Newest</strong>.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



### Intent Not Found

Intent Not Found includes all the user utterances that the platform is not able to identify with a dialog task or FAQ either due to invalid training, less training data, or the intent unavailability in the virtual assistant.

See the following table and Features section to know more:

<img src="../images/Intent-not-found.png" alt="Intent not Found" title="Intent not Found" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">


Example of Intent Not Found: 

_User: I want to know my account statement_

_VA: I’m sorry, I did not recognize the value you have entered. Please select a value from the list._

In the above conversation, the VA does not recognize the user utterance of _‘knowing the account statement’_. It could be due to invalid training, less training, or unavailability of intents in the virtual assistant.

**Description of Intent Not Found Fields**

The following table lists the fields on the Intent Not Found tab with descriptions:

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



### Unhandled Utterances

The Unhandled Utterances help analyze the unidentified inputs received from the users during a task execution at an **entity node, message node**, or **confirmation** node. These insights allow you to identify the need for additional training or new intents and enhance the existing NLU model of the VAs.

In an unhandled utterance, the following new fields are available:



* **Prompt Type** – A prompt type could be either an **Entity** node, **Message** node, or a **Confirmation** node.
* **Node Name**– Name of the node in which the utterance is not handled
* **Task Name** – Name of the task in which the utterances are unidentified on an entity, message, or confirmation nodes.

   <img src="../images/unhandled-utterances.png" alt="Unhandled Utterances" title="Unhandled Utterances" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">


* Group by functionality is available for **_Utterances, Traits, Prompt Type, Task Name, and Node Name_**

!!! note

    The unhandled utterances are available for all conversations with product version 9.3 or higher.


See the following table and Features section to know more.

Unhandled Utterance Examples

The following examples show the conversations between the VA and user, with unhandled utterances captured at **Entity**, **Message**, and **Confirmation** nodes.

**At an Entity Node**:

For example, when the user provides an invalid input at entity or confirmation nodes as follows:

_User: I want my account statement_

_VA: Please enter your Customer Id_

_User: Where do I find it?_

_VA: Sorry, that is an incorrect input. Please enter your Customer Id_

In the above conversation, if the VA doesn’t recognize _“where to find customer id”_ as an intent or entity, then this utterance is  categorized under Unhandled Utterances.

**At a Message Node**:

For example, when the user provides an invalid input at a message node as follows:

_User: I want to book a flight for today_

_VA: Enter the flight number
User: 12434
VA: Enter number of seats required
User: 3 
VA: Your flight is booked. Would you like to:
1. Book a Hotel 
2. Book a sightseeing tour
User: I want to Cancel the Flight
VA: I’m sorry, I don’t understand. Please enter again._

In the above conversation, if the VA doesn’t recognize the intent name “cancel flight” as an input at the message node. The intent identification fails and the utterance is categorized under Unhandled Utterances.

**At Confirmation Node**:

For example, when the user provides an invalid input at a confirmation node as follows:

_VA: How may I help you_

_User: I want to book a flight_

_VA: Enter the number of seats_

_User: 2_

_VA: Please confirm if you want two seats_

_User: I want to hire a cab_

_VA: I cannot understand it, can you rephrase it_

In the preceding conversation, when a user enters ‘I want to hire a cab’ at the confirmation node, it is not recognized and logged under Unhandled Utterances.

**Advanced Performance Details**

Clicking a service or script or WebHook name opens the advanced details dialog for the service, which lists each instance of its run along with separate tabs for successful and failed runs. Analyzing the average response time of different runs gives you insights into any aberrations in the service or script execution. Click any row to open the JSON response associated with the service or script run.


## Train the Virtual Assistant
