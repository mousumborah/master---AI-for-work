## Responses

Agents can send canned responses to customers based on their specific scenarios using the Responses widget.

Contact Center AI has default response categories that include:

* **Greeting**: Agents can send a welcome message like “Hello, How may I assist you?”
* **Conversational**: Agents can send general conversation responses like a follow-up and delay.
* **Closing**: Agents can send closing statements, feedback, request to fill up a survey, thank you, and chat again. They can also close the chat because of no response from the customer, etc.
* **Transfer**: Agents can transfer the interaction to a manager or alternate chat group.
* **Abuse**: Agents can use fair (initial) and final warning levels when the customer uses abusive language.
* **Privacy**: Agents can send permission-based service responses that enhance conversational privacy.

These are permission-based service responses that enhance conversational privacy.
