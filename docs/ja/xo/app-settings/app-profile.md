  Use the following options to configure the use of Search AI Answers.
  
  <b>Intent Identification Priority</b>: This priority is used when the bot needs to identify the intent from the initial user utterances. This can take the following values:
  
   <ul> 
    <li> Automation first, Search AI as Fallback: The assistant prioritizes the automation framework for identifying the intent and answering the user input. If intent identification or action fails, the assistant uses the Search AI to generate a response.</li>
    <li> Search AI first, Automation as Fallback: The assistant uses the Search AI application to answer. If no satisfactory match is found within the Search AI sources, the assistant uses the automation framework to handle the user inputs.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <b>Use Search AI for Unrecognized Inputs During Dialogs</b>: This option enhances the assistant's ability to handle diverse user inputs during Automation AI Dialog Tasks. If the NLP Engine fails to recognize an utterance, the system passes unidentified user inputs to Search AI, allowing access to the knowledge base mid-dialog. This improves conversation flow, reduces "I don't understand" responses, and allows for more diverse and comprehensive assistance throughout the dialog.

<li>Select <strong>General Public</strong> if the App is for public use for both managed and unmanaged users in your domain. VA assignments are not required and when the Bots Admin deploys the VA, it is available for use by all domain users. Use this option to make a VA widely available for all user types.

<li>Select <strong>Enterprise Users</strong> if the App is for managed users only in a domain, for example, for your employees or paid customers. After the Bots Admin approves and deploys this VA, it is not available to any managed users unless explicitly assigned by the Bots Admin. Use this option when you want to control which managed users in your domain can access and set up this VA on their devices.
Once the <strong>Target Audience</strong> is defined and saved, you cannot change them.

## Customizing Error Messages

In the Builder, each VA and task contains a set of predefined error messages along with actions for standard HTTP Status codes returned for an HTTP Request method. In most cases, the default response and action are sufficient for an end-user response, however, you may need to handle other HTTP Status codes not defined by default, or customize the error message itself, or change the default response by Kore.ai in the event of an error. This topic describes how to customize and create error messages for Kore.ai VAs and tasks. When you create a VA or a task, you can add or customize error messages for HTTP Status codes in the **Error Messages** section of the VA or task settings.

### Custom Status Codes

There are approximately 25 HTTP Status codes defined by default for a VA or task. **To customize an HTTP Status code**

  1. Open the app or task in UXO.
  2. Navigate to **Settings**.
  3. On the **App Profile** screen, scroll down to locate the **Error Messages** section.
  4. Click the **Edit** <img src="../images/app-prof-editicon.png" width="20" style="border: 1px solid gray;"> icon for the code that you want to customize to open the **Setup Error Message** dialog.  

      <img src="../images/app-prof-img3-general-settings-error-messages-setup.png" alt="Setup Error Message" title="Setup Error Message" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>  

  5. In the **Message Type** field, select one of:
    1. **Custom** – Displays a **Custom Message** field to define an error-specific message for the end-user.
    2. **Source** – Displays the **Error Paths** field where you can define the JSON path from the JSON response payload for HTTP Status codes other than those in the 2XX range (success messages).

  6. In the **Action** field, specify the action to take when the number of consecutive errors defined in the **Error Recurrence** field is reached. Select one of:
    1. **Disable** – The task is set to **Inactive** when the error occurs. The end-user can activate the task when needed.
    2. **Reschedule** – Displays the **Retry Interval** field used to define the elapsed time in minutes after which to retry the task when the error occurs.
    3. **Disable Auth** – When the error occurs, the authorization mechanism defined for the task is disabled. Any other task that uses the same authorization mechanism is also disabled.
    4. **Notify** – Displays the error message in the end-user interface.  
  <img src="../images/app-prof-img4-general-settings-error-messages-setup-actions.png" alt="Action on Error" title="Action on Error" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>   

  7. In the **Message** field (available only for the default messages), enter the text message displayed to the end-user.
  8. In the **Error Recurrence** field, specify the number of consecutive error codes must be returned before the action is executed. By default, the **Error Recurrence** field is set to ” 1 “.
  9. Click **Add** to save and close the **Setup Error Message** dialog for your custom error message.

To create a new HTTP Status code, click **Add Error Message**, define the fields for your new code as described in the preceding section, and then click **Add.**
