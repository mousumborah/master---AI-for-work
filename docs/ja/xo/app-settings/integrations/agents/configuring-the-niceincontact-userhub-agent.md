# Configuring the NiceInContact (User Hub) Agent

NiceInContact CXone virtual agent (user) hub simplifies the deployment of conversational virtual assistants and agents for customer self-service. Kore.ai XO Platform’s NiceInContact Agent integration allows you to seamlessly hand off the virtual assistant conversations to your live agents on Nice Chat.

Use the configuration steps below as general guidelines to enable the NiceInContact User Hub integration. You may notice minor differences based on the version of the NiceInContact User Hub you are using.


## Overview

Kore.ai’s virtual assistant (VA) serves as the central point of interaction for the users. The VA facilitates communication and interaction between the user and the NiceInContact User Hub. In addition to its regular capabilities, the VA acts as a proxy or intermediary between the users and the NiceInContact agents to hand over conversations seamlessly. The VA also allows you to integrate with the NiceInContact platform.


## Configuration

To configure the NiceInContact User Hub agent, follow the instructions below.


### Step 1: Generate Access Details for NiceInContact User Hub Account

Steps to generate access details:

1. Log in to [https://login.incontact.com/](https://login.incontact.com/){:target="_blank"} with your NiceInContact credentials.

6. Create a new Agent Transfer Node task. For example, create a Talk to Live Agent task with the LiveChats node and configure it to use the Nice agent. For more information, see [Agent Transfer Node](../../../../automation/use-cases/dialogs/node-types/working-with-the-agent-transfer-node){:target="_blank"}.
