# Configuring the NiceInContact

NiceInContact is a customer experience (CX) platform. It helps companies and consumers create an end-to-end CX approach, combining digital entry points, prepared agents, and a complete performance suite. Kore.ai XO Platform’s NiceInContact Agent integration allows you to seamlessly hand off the virtual assistant conversations to your live agents on Nice Chat.

Use the configuration steps below as general guidelines to enable the NiceInContact Agent integration. You may notice minor differences based on the version of the NiceInContact you are using.


## Overview

Kore.ai’s virtual assistant (VA) serves as the central point of interaction for the users. The VA facilitates communication and interaction between the user and the NiceInContact agent. In addition to its regular capabilities, the VA acts as a proxy or intermediary between the users and the NiceInContact agents to hand over conversations seamlessly. The VA also allows you to integrate with the NiceInContact platform.

5. Open a virtual assistant for which you have enabled the NiceInContact agent.
6. Create a new Agent Transfer Node task. For example, create a Talk to Live Agent task with the LiveChats node and configure it to use the Nice agent.
