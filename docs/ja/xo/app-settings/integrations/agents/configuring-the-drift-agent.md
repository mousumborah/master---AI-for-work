# Configuring the Drift Agent

Drift is a conversation cloud platform. It helps marketing and sales teams to connect with customers easily through the conversation chat module. Kore.ai XO Platform’s Drift Agent integration allows you to seamlessly hand off the virtual assistant conversations to your live agents on Drift.

Use the configuration steps below as general guidelines to enable the Drift Agent integration. You may notice minor differences based on the version of the Drift you are using.


## Overview

Kore.ai’s virtual assistant (VA) serves as the central point of interaction for the users. The VA facilitates communication and interaction between the user and the Drift agent using the chat module. In addition to its regular capabilities, the VA acts as a proxy or intermediary between the users and the Drift agents to hand over conversations seamlessly. The VA also allows you to integrate with the Drift platform.


## Configuration

To configure the Drift agent, follow the instructions in the sections below.


### Step1: Create a Drift App

Create an external integration in Drift to receive messages.

1. Log in to [https://dev.drift.com/apps](https://dev.drift.com/apps){:target="_blank"} with your drift credentials.
2. Go to the App Store and click Create New App. To create an app, follow the instructions at [https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/quick-start](https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/quick-start){:target="_blank"}.

5. If you want to make Drift the default agent, enable the **Default Agent System for all bot channels** option.

## Execution

This section helps you verify how the conversations from the Kore.ai XO Platform are being handed over to the Drift agent after enabling it.

To verify the data exchange between Kore.ai’s VA and Drift agent, follow these steps:

1. Open a virtual assistant for which you have enabled the Drift agent.
2. Create a new **Agent Transfer Node** task. For example, create a **Talk to Live Agent** task with the **LiveChats** node and configure it to use the Drift agent. For more information, see [Agent Transfer Node](../../../../automation/use-cases/dialogs/node-types/working-with-the-agent-transfer-node){:target="_blank"}.

    <img src="../images/configuring-the-drift-agent-img10.png" alt="New Agent Transfer Node task" title="New Agent Transfer Node task" style="border: 1px solid gray;">

3. Add an email entity node and bot action to capture the email address of an agent.
4. Enter the following script in the Bot Action script:  
    `agentUtils.setMetaInfo("email", context.entities.Entity0001);`

    <img src="../images/configuring-the-drift-agent-img11.png" alt="Bot Action script" title="Bot Action script" style="border: 1px solid gray;">

5. Click the **Talk to Bot** icon to launch the VA and enter **Help**.
6. Once you invoke the agent transfer dialog, the Drift Developer Hub receives a notification alert.
7. When a user initiates the chat from the VA, it transfers the conversation to the Drift agent and sends a message to the user. Agent receives a notification about this on Drift.
8. Now, the connection between the Drift agent and the user has been established, and the conversation continues.
