# Using the Azure OpenAI Action Templates

You can use the **Prebuilt Action Templates** from your Azure OpenAI integration to auto-create dialog tasks and test them using the **Talk to Bot** option.

Steps to create a dialog task using the Azure OpenAI action templates:

1. Ensure that you have configured [Azure OpenAI](configuring-the-azure-openai-action.md){:target="_blank"} and [installed templates](configuring-the-azure-openai-action.md#step-3-install-the-azure-openai-action-templates){:target="_blank"} successfully.
If you have configured it and skipped installing the templates, see [Marketplace](../marketplace.md){:target="_blank"} to install the templates.

2. Go to **Automation AI** > **Virtual Assistant** > **Use Cases** > **Dialogs**. All the dialogs are displayed.


3. Click the auto-created dialog. The the canvas opens with all required entity nodes, service nodes, and message scripts.
