# Using the OpenAI Action Templates

You can use the **Prebuilt Action Templates** from your OpenAI integration to auto-create dialog tasks and test them using the **Talk to Bot** option.

Steps to create a dialog task using OpenAI action templates:

1. Go to **Automation AI** > **Virtual Assistant** > **Use Cases** > **Dialogs**.
2. Click **Create a Dialog Task**.  


2. On the Dialog Task pop-up, under the **Integration**, select the **OpenAI** option to view the action templates.

Researched, designed and developed a system that uses AI plus Mathematical techniques to assist users in producing on-stage video content using various Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms and frameworks like Tensorflow, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, etc. Worked on application software development and NLP analysis at a Global-level Project. Used KMeans Clustering Algorithm for Customer Request Analytics on a data consisting of more than million text words.Worked on two project leaflets that were built and deployed using Python and Tensorflow. The first one was a Neural Network based approach for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis that can generate real-time voice cloning (speech audio) in the voice of different speakers. The second model involves the use of object detection and pose estimation to count the number of workout steps done. Worked as Research Intern mainly on design and prototype of advanced automated aerated system using normal mobile application and Wi-Fi technology. In this project, sensor coding and a flexible Automated Aerated System using Arduino micro-controller and NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module was proposed and implemented.",
