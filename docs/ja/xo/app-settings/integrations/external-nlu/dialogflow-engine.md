# Dialogflow Engine

The Dialogflow engine is responsible for understanding user inputs and providing relevant responses based on pre-defined intents and entities. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to identify the user’s intent and extract relevant information from their inputs. It also enables developers to build complex conversational flows, manage context, and integrate with external APIs. To use the Dialogflow engine for Natural Language Understanding, you need to create the agent and train the model on Dialogflow if you don’t have one already. The following sections detail the agent creation and training steps and also explain how to obtain the information needed to configure the Dialogflow ES Adapter. Once all the configurations are done, you can start [testing the conversation behavior/flow](../test-and-debug/){:target="_blank"} of the bot using your Dialogflow ES model.


## Train the Dialogflow Engine

Dialogflow ES NLU is one of the external NLU adapters. If you want to configure the Dialogflow ES adapter, you need the Project ID and private key obtained from the JSON file in the google cloud console. See [Enable the Dialogflow API](#enable-the-dialogflow-api) and [Create Service Account Credentials](#create-service-account-credentials) to understand how to obtain the Project ID and the Private Key. These sections explain training and usage of the Dialogflow NLU engine.

**Prerequisites:** You need to have at least one agent created on the [Dialogflow Essentials](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/){:target="_blank"} page, to be able to configure the intent, entity nodes, or FAQs.

To enable intent and entity detection using the Dialogflow engine during a user conversation, you need to create the intents and entities on the [Dialogflow Essentials](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/){:target="_blank"} cloud page with the same names used during their creation on Kore.ai XO Platform.

The following steps explain how to create an agent, intent and test the configuration.



1. Go to [Dialogflow Essentials](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/){:target="_blank"} and click Create Agent, if you don’t have any available agent. In this example an agent with the name **Test_Dialogflow** is created.

3. In this example an intent with name Phone Number Verification is created as we have the same user intent in the VA.
4. Under **Action and Parameters**, add Action as per the name of the entity. Add the **Parameter** Name, **Entity, Value** and the **Prompt** details.  
<img src="../images/external-nlu-dialogflow-engine-img3.png" alt="Add action, parameter, entity, value, prompt" title="Add action, parameter, entity, value, prompt" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>

5. Under **Responses → Default**, add the **Text Response** to be displayed for the user.  
<img src="../images/external-nlu-dialogflow-engine-img4.png" alt="Add text response" title="Add text response" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>

6. Click **Save** to save the configuration.
7. Go to **Training** in the left side menu and enter the intent name at **User Says**.  
<img src="../images/external-nlu-dialogflow-engine-img5.png" alt="Go go Training and enter Intent name" title="Go go Training and enter Intent name" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>

8. Enter the intent name same as it is in the VA, in the top most right corner of the page in **Try Now**, to test the Dialogflow configuration.
9. The configured text response would be displayed under the **Default Response**.  
<img src="../images/external-nlu-dialogflow-engine-img6.png" alt="Configured text response displayed under Default Response" title="Configured text response displayed under Default Response" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>  
  
    !!! note

        You can configure any intents, entities or FAQ details which you require to be identified using the Dialogflow ES adapter.
