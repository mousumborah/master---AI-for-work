# Knowledge AI

The Knowledge AI or Knowledge Graph (KG) lets you turn static FAQ text into an intelligent, personalized conversational experience. There are two types of knowledge graphs:

* The **Ontology-based Knowledge Graph** lets you create an ontological structure of key domain terms and associate them with context-specific questions and their alternatives, synonyms, and Machine learning-enabled traits.
* The **Few-Shot Knowledge Graph** leverages Kore.aiâ€™s Large Language Model (LLM) to simplify knowledge organization and KG training, letting you add FAQs to the root node without building and maintaining an ontology structure.
