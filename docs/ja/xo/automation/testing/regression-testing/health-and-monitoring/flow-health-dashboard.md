# Flow Health


## Introduction 

The **Flow Health** dashboard summarizes how well the flows of Virtual Assistant (VA) are performing and shows the coverage of intents and transitions in the bot definition. The Flow Health dashboard displays the overall pass or fail percentage of test cases with options to view the transitions coverage. 

The Flow Health dashboard also shows the summary of user intents that are covered and missed in test cases. You can review the uncovered intents and add relevant test cases to cover missing user intents in the test suite. 

You can also use the test result analysis to identify the issues in the dialog task definitions and fix them with actionable recommendations to improve overall NLU and Flow health.

**Note**: The Flow Health Dashboard is available on the XO Platform version 10.0, released on Jan 21st, 2023.


### Use-Case Scenario

In this article, the Hotel Booking virtual assistant is used as an example to understand the flow of transitions and test results analysis. The Hotel Booking VA has the _Search A Hotel_, _Book a Hotel, Get User Data, Show User Data, and Raise Complain_ dialog intents with various test cases in the test suites in the Conversation Testing module.

A transition shows how a user intent is transferred from one sequence to another sequence in a dialog task. A transition is a flow of intent between two sequences. It has a **From** sequence and a **To** sequence.  For example, **Book a Hotel** is a user intent in a dialog task. A **entCity** is an entity node in the **Gather Booking Data - Location** sequence within dialog flow to which the **book a hotel** user intent is transitioned, and after going through all the nodes in this sequence, it transitions to the **Gather Booking data - Stay Period** sequence. From there, after all nodes in it are executed, it transitions to **Gather Booking data - Room and Guest details** and finally **MAke reservation and show Confirmation** sequences. Therefore, in the **Book a Hotel** task, you have three transitions in total. For more information, see [User Intent](../../../../use-cases/dialogs/node-types/working-with-the-user-intent-node){:target="_blank"}.

Once you record a conversation flow, save it and run it in the _Conversation Testing_ module.  The conversation testing module helps in knowing how a dialog task performs. For example, if you have a **Get User Data** dialog task and want to see how this dialog task is performing, you can create a **Show User Data** test suite with various test cases. Run the **Show User Data** test suite and see whether it was completed _successfully_, _failed_, _paused_, or _not executed_. For more information, see the [Conversation Testing](../../conversation-testing/conversation-testing-landing-page/){:target="_blank"} article.

The test suite results are tracked in the _Conversation Testing,_ and the analytics for test suites are displayed in the **Flow Health** dashboard.  


## How to Use the Flow Health Dashboard

To access the **Flow Health Dashboard**, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Testing** > **Regression Testing** > **Health & Monitoring** and select the **Flow** tab.  
<img src="../images/select-flow-tab.png" alt="Flow health dashboard" title="Flow health dashboard" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>

2. Drill down to learn how to view the Dialog Intent, FAQ, and Small Talk summary sections. In these sections, you can view the intent level summaries, along with test coverage details to easily identify the transitions or intents to be covered. You can also expand to the test case results to view the execution analytics.  
  
**Note**: The test suites are used to verify the Intents, Small Talks, FAQs, and Standard Responses with test cases. The Flow Health dashboard considers standard responses in test cases to calculate overall percentages. However, the dashboard has no separate summary tile for the Standard Responses. For this reason, you will notice a slight difference in the test results’ overall count or percentage.


### Flow Metrics

The Flow Health dashboard extrapolates all test suite results from the conversation testing and presents insights into your test cases with performance analytics.

View the overall percentage of the test case results in the test suites with the following flow metrics:

  * **Pass** – Total Number of test cases passed across all test suites.
  * **Fail** – Total Number of Test cases failed across all test suites.
  * **Not Executed** – Total Number of Test cases aborted or not executed before execution across all test suites.

## Flow Dashboard Components

The key components of the Flow Health dashboard include transition coverage and intent summary panels for the test suites. The details on the available panels are explained below.


## Dialog Intent Summary

The **Dialog Intent Summary** shows the summary of test results analysis of dialog intents in the test cases from the Conversation Testing. The Dialog Intent summary also provides insights into flow transitions that are covered and ones that are missed.

In the **Dialog Intent Summary** region, you can view flow transitions and test result analysis-level summaries, along with the test coverage, to easily identify intents to be covered. You can drill down to view the analytics of test results.

**Note**: All the test cases across test suites expecting a dialog node for assertion are considered for generating the flow summary. 


### Transitions Coverage 

The Flow Health dashboard calculates the number of transitions in a dialog and shows the analysis of covered and not covered transitions. The **Transition Coverage** section helps you quickly understand how transitions are performing and fix issues in the specific transitions with actionable recommendations. You can analyze the transitions that are missed and add relevant test cases in the test suite to cover them in multiple iterations.

The percentage of transitions coverage is displayed as follows: 

  * **Total Transitions Covered** – Shows all covered transitions out to total transitions in the VA definition. 
  * **Covered** – Shows the number of transitions that are covered in the test cases.
  * **Not Covered** – Shows the percentage of total transitions that are not covered in the test cases.
