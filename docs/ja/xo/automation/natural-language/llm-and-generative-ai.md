# LLM and Generative AI Features

The Kore.ai XO Platform helps enhance your bot development process and enrich end-user conversational experiences by integrating pre-built (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic) or custom models or Kore.ai XO GPT Module in the backend.

In addition to the out-of-box integration with pre-built models, the platform supports the bring-your-own (BYO) model framework to integrate with externally hosted models by third parties and enterprises.

The new Kore.ai XO GPT Models module provides fine-tuned large language models optimized for enterprise conversational AI applications. These models have been evaluated and fine-tuned to be accurate, safe, and efficient for production deployment. For more information, see [Kore.ai XO GPT](../../generative-ai-tools/xo-gpt-module.md).


To configure LLM and Generative AI, click the **Generative AI Tools** icon in the left navigation.

## Key Features

The Integration of LLM and Generative AI enables the following features:

* Model Library: Connect to various Generative AI models using pre-built integrations, custom integrations, or the Kore.ai XO GPT Module. [Learn more](../../generative-ai-tools/models-library.md)

* Prompts Library: Create customized prompts for specific use cases. [Learn more](../../generative-ai-tools/prompts-library.md)

* Co-Pilot features: Automatic Dialog Generation, Conversation Test Cases Suggestion, Conversation Summary, NLP Batch Test Cases Suggestion, Training Utterance Suggestions, and Use Case Suggestions. [Learn more](../../generative-ai-tools/co-pilot-features.md)
    
* Dynamic Conversations features: GenAI Node for entity collection, Answer from documents, GenAI Prompt for custom use cases, Rephrase Dialog Responses, Zero-shot and Few-shot ML Models, Repeat Responses, and Rephrase User Query. [Learn more](../../generative-ai-tools/dynamic-conversations-features.md) 


* Safeguards: [Data Anonymization](../../generative-ai-tools/data-anonymization.md) and [Guardrails](../../generative-ai-tools/guardrails.md).
 

## Benefits

All these features benefit VA developers, NLP developers, and testers as follows:


* Choose between custom and pre-built LLM integrations. 
* Quickly create dialog tasks. 
* Build custom use cases with Generative AI. 
* Automate mundane tasks (dialog generation, training utterances). 
* Get suggestions for better VA design and development. 
* Customize connections to LLMs and optimize prompts for specific use cases.


## Getting Started


1. Integrate a [pre-built or custom LLM or Kore.ai XO GPT](../../generative-ai-tools/models-library.md) in models library. 
2. Create [New Prompts](../../generative-ai-tools/prompts-library.md) in the prompts library.
3. Enable [Co-Pilot](../../generative-ai-tools/co-pilot-features.md) and [Dynamic Conversations](../../generative-ai-tools/dynamic-conversations-features.md) features.
4. (Optional) Enable [Data Anonymization](../../generative-ai-tools/data-anonymization.md) and [Guardrails](../../generative-ai-tools/guardrails.md).
