# Configure Digital Forms

In this How-To, we will explore a scenario in a Banking Bot, where the user can create an additional account. We will see how Digital Forms can be used to gather all the required information from the user and create the account.

For details on what Digital Forms are and how it is implemented in the XO Platform, click [here](../../digital-skills/digital-forms/){:target="_blank"}.

## Illustration with an Example

Consider a Banking Bot trying to address the following scenarios:

1. An already registered user wants to open an additional account.
2. There are three types of accounts that are available, each with further options:
    * Savings Account.
    * Checking Account with an option to opt for a Cash Card and set the miniumum balance.
    * Credit Card with an option to choose the type of card to be Platinum, Gold, Silver or Basic.

### Prerequisites

* Bot building knowledge.
* A configured Banking Bot.

## Configurations

Let us consider each of the following scenarios:

1. Digital Form to gather input from the user;
2. Dialog Task to:
    * Trigger the above Digital Form.
    * Capture the user-entered account information.

### Digital Form Configuration

Create a form to gather the following information:

* **Account Name** – pre-populated with the user’s name with an option to change it;
* **Type of Account** that the user wants to create, default selection to Savings Account;
* Based on the type of account selected above the following details to be gathered:
    * **Savings** – No further information required.
    * **Checkings** – Whether Cash Card is required, if yes then the maximum withdrawal limit (range between $100 to $1000) to be enforced on that card;
    * **Credit Card** – The type of card required
        * Platinum card (levies additional charge).
        * Gold
        * Silver
        * Basic
    * **Trading** - Identity proof required.

### Form Creation

1. From the Kore.ai Bot Builder platform, open the Banking Bot.
2. Navigate to **Automation AI > Virtual Assistant > Digital Skills > Digital Forms** to access the Digital Forms page.
3. Click **New Form** and enter the following:
    * **Name** – name of the form that will be used by the engine, let's set as _OpenNewAccount_
    * **Display Name** for the form, let's set as _Open an Account_
    * **Description** of the form.
        **Select form’s Header Style**: You can choose a specific header style from the listed illustrations – the circle indicates the position of logo/icon with respect to the title of the form in the header. 

        Click the card to select the style. If it has a logo, you can upload an image file (png or jpg) for the logo.
        
        !!! Note

            During the Export of the Bot, the logo is not exported along with Digital Forms. So, while importing this Bot, you need to separately copy the logo image file and then manually reupload the logo.
        
4. **Description**: Turn on the toggle to show a description of the form in the header.
5. **Save & Proceed** to the next step.

### Form Editor

1. Form Editor opens with components on the left, and a blank form. You can drag and drop components to the form as per your requirement.
2. By default, a **Submit button** is added to the form. This would trigger the submit event which would capture the user input and save in context object.
3. Drag and drop a **Text Field** component onto the form.
4. As soon as you drag and drop a component, its property settings panel will be displayed.
5. In that panel congigure the following settings:
    * **Display Name** set as _Name._
    * **Name** used for internal reference, set as _accountname._
    * **Description** of the field.
    * **Placeholder** value to be displayed in the field when blank, set as, _Enter the name of the account holder_.
      <img src="../../images/form-editor-panel.png" alt="form editor panel" title="form editor panel" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

    * **Mask User Input/Secure Field Data** is a toggle under **Data Settings** that enables securing of the input data. The label of this toggle varies as below:
        * If **Secure Form Data** is enabled, the caption of this toggle is **Mask User Input**. At runtime, the input data is masked.
        * If **Secure Form Data** is disabled, the caption of this toggle is **Secure Field Data**. At runtime, the data of this field will be redacted. This would be a component level setting for data redaction.

    * **Transient Input** is a toggle under **Data Settings** which, if enabled, ensures that the data provided in this field is not stored anywhere after the session ends. This would mean that the data won't be available in the database or logs as well.

        <img src="../../images/mask-data-and-transient-input.png" alt="Field data securing and Transient data" title="Field data securing and Transient data" style="border:1px solid gray;">

    !!! Note

        **Mask User Input/Secure Field Data** and **Transient Input** toggles are available for all the components, and need to be set on component level. Settings of one component will have no impact on others.

6. Next, a selection box for the type of account to be opened. Drag and drop a **Dropdown** component onto the form and set the following values:
    * **Display Name** set as _Account Type._
    * **Name** used for internal reference, set as _accounttype._
    * **Description** of the field.
    * **Placeholder** value to be displayed in the field when blank, set as, _Select the type of account you want to open_.
7. Scroll and locate **Data Settings**, and deselect **Multi Select** option.
8. Against **Dropdown values** click **Add Values** to enter the values – _Checking, Savings, Credit Card, Trading._ You can mark one value, _Savings_, as default. This would be selected by default at the time of execution.

11. Add **Visibility Rules – Rule 1** for the field to be **Visible**, select **accounttype** field, _=(Equal To)_ operator, _Value_ comparison with, _Checkings_ value.

    <img src="../../images/visibility-rules.png" alt="visibility rules" title="visibility rules" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

12. If the user opts for cash card, then the withdrawal limit needs to be set on the same. Drag and drop a **Range Slider** component onto the form and set the following values:
    * **Display Name** set as _Withdrawal Limit._
    * **Name** used for internal reference, set as _withdrawallimit._
    * **Description** of the field.
    * **Placeholder** value to be displayed in the field when blank, set as, _Set the withdrawal limit_.

13. Deselect **Is Percentage**
14. Select **Value** as _100_ for Min and _10000_ for Max.
15. Under **Data Settings** you can set the **Default Value** to be 150, this would be pre-selected.
16. **Visibility Rules** would be a compound rule – account type is checkings and cash card is selected.
17. Scroll and locate **Visibility Settings.** This component should be visible only when the account type is set to Checkings and the Cash Card is opted.

23. Finally, the Pro-Tip, when user selects a Platinum card. Drag and drop a **Pro Tip** component onto the form and set the following values:
    * Set **Display Name** as _Platinum Tip._
    * **Name** used for internal reference, mention _platinumtip._
    * **Description** would be the tip you want to display, eg. _Additional charges will apply_.

    <img src="../../images/view-visibility-settings.png" alt="visibility settings" title="visibility settings" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

    Your form is ready. You can toggle between Desktop View and Mobile View to see how it looks in those devices. 

    <img src="../../images/toggle-views.png" alt="toggle views" title="toggle views" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

25. You can select how the VA handles the conversation when the user cancels the form. You can choose from two options:
    
    * **Discard the task and trigger End of Task Event**: This is the default option.

        <img src="../../images/discard-task.png" alt="discard task" title="discard task" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">
 
    * **Continue with this task and transition to this node**: In the **Select Node** drop-down list, you can select any node present in the current dialog task.

        <img src="../../images/select-node-dropdown.png" alt="select node dropdown" title="select node dropdown" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

        !!! Note
    
            The target node has to be in the same dialog, you cannot make a jump to a target node outside the current dialog. The list of target nodes only shows the local nodes.

            If the target node is not present during runtime, the platform presents the error Error in continuing the conversation, and the task should get discarded.

26. Use the **Test** button to see a preview.

### Dialog Task Configuration

We will be creating a dialog task and adding a form node to trigger the Digital Form created in the above step and use a service node to make a service call to add the new account from the form data.

### Create Dialog Task

1. Navigate to **Automation AI > Virtual Assistant > Dialog Tasks.**
2. Click the **Create Dialog** button to create a new Task.
3. Select the **Start from Scratch** option.
4. Provide below details:
    * Enter **IntentName**, set as, _Open Bank Account_
    * Click **Proceed** to open the dialog builder page.

5. Retain the Root Intent Node's default settings.
6. Click the **+** next to the Root intent node and select the form (_OpenNewAccount_) that we created earlier from the list. Note that the form name will contain numeric suffix in the form of 001, 002 and so on depending on the number of its instances already added to the VA. 

    <img src="../../images/select-created-form.png" alt="select created form" title="select created form" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

7. You will be prompted to select the **Form Experience**. XO Platform allows you to gather user input both from the form and through conversation based on the channel.
8. For this use case, select _Only Form UI_ experience.
9. A New sequence containing the Form Node would be added, you can customize the form name, etc.
10. We are changing the **Name** to _OpenAccountForm_ and **Display Name** to _Form to open account_.

### Capture Form Node Values

Next, to capture the values returned by the Form Node using a Script node and displaying the same, follow the steps below:

1. Add a **Message Node** in the sequence under the form node.
2. Set the **Name** to _FormDataMessage_ and **Display Name** to _Form Data Message_.
3. Hover on the **Sample Bot Response for All Channels** and **Edit** icon to open the message editor.

    <img src="../../images/click-manage-responses.png" alt="select js" title="select js" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

4. Select the **Custom JavaScript** option and enter the following code. This code would capture from the context object, the data submitted by the user in the Form and display it accordingly. 

    ```
    var message;
    message = 'You have opened a '+context.forms.OpenAccount.accounttype+' account in the name of '+context.forms.OpenAccount.accountname;
    if (context.forms.OpenAccount.accounttype == 'Checkings' && context.forms.OpenAccount.cashcard == 'Yes')
    message = message + ' and opted for cash card with withdrawal limit set to '+ context.forms.OpenAccount.withdrawallimit;
    if (context.forms.OpenAccount.accounttype == 'Credit Card')
    message = message + ' and opted for a '+ context.forms.OpenAccount.cardtype+' card';
    print(message);
    ```
    
    <img src="../../images/select-javascript.png" alt="select js" title="select js" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

Your dialog with form is ready! **Test** and trigger the above dialog. The form will be displayed, enter the values and click Submit, the message would be displayed. 

<img src="../../images/talk-to-bot.png" alt="talk to bot" title="talk to bot" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

You can use the context object as shown above it a **Script** or **Service** nodes for further processing.
