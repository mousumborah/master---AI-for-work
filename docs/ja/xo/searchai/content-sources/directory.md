# Documents

Business information is available in a variety of formats and at various locations. This information is also available as documents and files on internal servers. Search AI allows uploading and indexing files or directories hosted on local machines or remote servers. This functionality streamlines the process of locating information, eliminating the need to manually locate specific documents and sift through their contents, thus reducing manual efforts and enabling efficient information retrieval, saving users time and resources.

Search AI allows you to **upload one or more files or directories from the local device or a given URL**. The uploaded files are organized into directories in the application. A default directory is always present to store files. Once a file is successfully uploaded to the application, it is automatically indexed, and the file data is readily available to answer user queries.

!!!note
    Search AI supports files in various formats: PDF, DOCX, PPT, and TXT. However, scanned PDFs and password-protected files are not currently supported.  

## Viewing Files and Directories

Go to the **Sources** page and click the **Directory** tab. This lists all the directories configured as content sources.

![Directory Home](../images/directory/documents-home.png "directory home")

For each directory, it lists the number of files present in it, its owner, the timestamp of the last update made to it, and the status of file uploads to it. By default, the **Default Directory** always exists. You can upload files to this default directory or create new directories and upload files to those directories. 

Click any of the directories in the list to view their details. The **Directory Details** page shows the directory's properties and the **Files** tab lists the files in the directory, including their type and number of pages. 

![Directory Details](../images/directory/directory-details.png "Directory Details")

Click any of the files to see more details about the file, like file type, total number of pages, and a preview of the file. 

![File Summary](../images/directory/file-summary.png "File Summary")

Click the **JSON view** button to see the file details extracted from the file in JSON format.
