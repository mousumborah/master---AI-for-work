# Content Browser

The Content Browser provides a tool to observe the extracted chunks from the source data.

This not only allows you to view and verify the extracted chunks but also allows you to edit them, enabling you to work with answers that best serve your specific goals and requirements.

## Key capabilities

* **Observation and Verification:** You can use the Browser to inspect and verify the extracted chunks. This step is crucial for ensuring the correctness of the extraction process, the accuracy of the chunks generated, and to ensure that no data is lost during extraction.
