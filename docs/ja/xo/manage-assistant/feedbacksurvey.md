# Feedback Survey

The Kore.ai XO Platform allows you to design and create feedback surveys for products, services, and overall experiences using out-of-the-box templates on the web and mobile channels. You can configure a Virtual Assistant to launch these surveys at a certain point in a conversation or at the end of a conversation (when the _end-of-conversation_ event is triggered). The **NPS**, **CSAT**, and **Like/Dislike** survey types are currently supported.

!!! Key Feature Highlights

    1. The Feedback Module is use-case and channel-agnostic. But by default, it only shows text messages. You can always add additional channel-specific prompts to collect feedback from voice channels.
    2. When a feedback survey is created on the platform, all messages are in text format. The text from the platform gets converted into a voice using the ASR and TTS engines.
    3. You can leverage channel-specific configuration to modify the feedback prompts.
    4. Feedback flows are fully customizable.
    5. The Kore.ai XO Platform lets you configure feedback in two ways:
        * Using the built-in flows to collect the feedback and the new service type called **feedback service** to submit the feedback to the bots platform.
        * Collecting feedback from other sources that can be pushed to the platform as part of the conversation execution.
    6. Feedback Surveys are created as dialog tasks with a series of entities, service calls, and message notes. You have complete control of modifying the out-of-the-box messages, adding additional messages to specific channels, such as voice channels, and capturing the feedback on voice.
    7. You can use the automatic feedback template that the platform generates or build their flows and submit the feedback to the platform feedback service. Alternatively, it could be a hybrid approach where the feedback flow can emerge from or integrate with another flow.
    8. Once a customer responds to a Feedback Survey, the event displays on the chat transcript slider of the Conversations History Dashboard.[ Learn more](../../analytics/overview/conversations-history){:target="_blank"}.
    9. Additionally, you can filter and analyze Conversations (with feedback survey enabled) based on the Feedback Type, Response, and Score using prebuilt and custom filters.[ Learn more](../../analytics/overview/conversations-history/#prebuilt-filters-for-conversations-history){:target="_blank"}.
    10. The feedback response from a customer is captured and pushed to the platform for further analysis in three ways:
        * By creating a **Dialog** to capture feedback responses/scores and generate the required analytics to derive actionable insights on the **Feedback Analysis Dashboard**.[ Learn more](../../analytics/overview/feedback-dashboard){:target="_blank"}.
        * By pushing feedback data to the platform using the Public API.[ Learn more](../../apis/automation/fetch-feedback-survey-scores/){:target="_blank"}.
        * By pushing feedback data via the Botkit.[ Learn more](../../sdk/using-the-botkit-sdk/#feedback-survey){:target="_blank"}.
    11. In addition to the primary survey question, you can configure a **Follow-up Question** for negative feedback to gather specific details and better understand any primary survey issues.
    12. Additionally, you can set an Acknowledgement Message to customers after they complete the survey to show appreciation and let them know that it has been received.

## Feedback Template Types

The Platform provides the following in-built feedback template types, to create and define a feedback survey:


### NPS Scale Categorization

Known as the **_New Promoter Score_**, this is a standard customer experience metric that measures the experience and loyalty of customers based on their feedback responses. For a single-question survey, respondents give a rating between 0 (not at all likely) and 10 (extremely likely), and based on their response, they fall into one of the following NPS score categories:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Customer Category</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>NPS Score</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Promoters</strong>
   </td>
   <td>9 & 10
   </td>
   <td>This score indicates a loyal customer who is satisfied with the conversation and is highly likely to return.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Passives</strong>
   </td>
   <td>6,7, & 8
   </td>
   <td>This score represents a satisfied customer who may or may not be willing to continue the conversation and return for a service.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Detractors</strong>
   </td>
   <td>0,1,2,3,4, & 5
   </td>
   <td>This score indicates that the customer is unsatisfied with the conversation and has given negative feedback. As a result, the customer will mostly not return to the platform and may detract other customers by sharing their experiences.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


### CSAT Score Categorization

**CSAT** or **Customer SATisfaction** is a customer experience metric that measures or quantifies how happy the customer is with a Virtual Assistant interaction. The customer is asked to rate on a **five-point scale**, **1** meaning very satisfied and **5** meaning very unsatisfied, for a survey question like “_How satisfied were you with the conversation?_” The response score is mapped to the relevant category as shown below:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Category</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Score</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Very Satisfied</strong>
   </td>
   <td>1
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Satisfied</strong>
   </td>
   <td>2
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Neutral</strong>
   </td>
   <td>3
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Unsatisfied</strong>
   </td>
   <td>4
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Very Unsatisfied</strong>
   </td>
   <td>5
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Like/Dislike

The customer is asked to respond to the feedback survey by clicking a **Like** or **Dislike** icon. **Like** or **Extremely Likely** denotes the customer’s positive experience and is allocated a score of 1 internally. **Dislike** or **Extremely Unlikely** indicates a negative customer experience, and is allocated a score of 0 internally.

### Step 2: Define the Survey Design

You can define how to present the survey in the **Survey Design** stage which includes the following:

* Gathering the customer’s feedback using one of the out-of-the-box default templates.
* Defining the primary question that will be posed to the customer when the system triggers the feedback survey.
* Setting the follow-up questions based on the feedback conditionally.

To define the survey design, follow the steps below:

1. Select the relevant option in the **Add Feedback Survey** window based on how you want to create the survey.
2. If you want to create a new Feedback Survey along with a **Dialog Task** (customizable) which will have the flow required to collect the feedback and capture the analytics, select **Create a survey with a New Dialog** and follow the steps below:

    * Enter the **Dialog Name** in the text area.

        <img src="../images/feedback-survey-dialog-name.png" alt="Feedback survey with New dialog" title="Feedback survey with New dialog" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">

    * Set the default **Primary Question** to be posed to the customer for the selected survey type when it’s triggered.

        <img src="../images/feedback-survey-primary-question.png" alt="Feedback survey - Primary question" title="Feedback survey - Primary question" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">

    * Alternatively, modify/change the **Primary Question** in the text area.
    * The **Primary Question** response options the customer will see are displayed below based on the selected survey type:

    **NPS**

4. Optional Step: To capture additional details from the customer for negative feedback, configure the **follow-up question** with the steps below:
    * Enable the **Follow-up Question** option (default setting). 

        <img src="../images/feedback-survey-follow-up-question.png" alt="Feedback survey - Follow-up question" title="Feedback survey - Follow-up question" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">

    * Define when to post the follow-up question by configuring the **IF condition**, where you must select the conditional option from the list for **User Score**. 

        <img src="../images/feedback-survey-follow-up-question-condition.png" alt="Feedback survey - Follow-up question Condition" title="Feedback survey - Follow-up question Condition" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">

    * Next, increment or decrement the **feedback score counter** for the selected condition to set the validation criterion. 

        <img src="../images/feedback-survey-score-counter.png" alt="Feedback survey - Score counter" title="Feedback survey - Score counter" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">

    * Either edit the default follow-up question in the text area provided for the **THEN** clause or keep it unchanged. 

        <img src="../images/feedback-survey-then-clause.png" alt="Feedback survey - THEN clause" title="Feedback survey - THEN clause" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">

5. Modify the **Acknowledgement Message** in the text area or retain the default message to acknowledge the customer’s effort in taking the survey. 

    <img src="../images/feedback-survey-acknowledgement.png" alt="Feedback survey - Acknowledgement Message" title="Feedback survey - Acknowledgement Message" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">

6. Click **Next** to move to the survey launch configuration.


### Step 3: Define Launch Configuration

After defining the survey, you can choose how and when to launch the survey in one of the following ways with the **Launch Configuration**:

1. Associate the survey with the end-of-task (conversation) event.
2. Add the survey task as a sub-dialog to other primary tasks.

To configure the feedback survey launch, follow the steps below:

1. Select one of the following options:
    * **Launch after End of Task**: The dialog task is considered as the ‘_End of Task_‘ event, and the survey is triggered at the end of every conversation. When selected, **_End of Task_** (**End of Conversation** Event) under **Automation AI > Events > Conversation Events > End Of Task** will be overridden and the feedback survey is launched. Through the survey dialog you’ve created in the previous step.
    * **I will decide how to launch the Survey**: You can manually initiate the feedback survey at any time by using the associated dialog task in the Kore.ai XO platform. A dialog task will be made available under Build → Conversational Skills. This allows you to control when the survey is launched and gather feedback at your own convenience.

        <img src="../images/feedback-survey-when-to-launch.png" alt="Feedback survey - When to launch" title="Feedback survey - When to launch" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">

2. Click **Create** to launch the feedback survey. A success confirmation message, as shown below, is displayed with your survey details.

    <img src="../images/feedback-survey-created.png" alt="Feedback survey Successfully Created" title="Feedback survey Successfully Created" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">


## Feedback Survey Dialog Flow

After you’ve created the survey, you can view the built-in survey flow as a dialog task under **Build** > **Conversational Skills** > **Dialog Tasks** on the left menu.

The **Task Flow** will include a combination of **Entity**, **Message**, and **Service** nodes to represent the survey flow.

You can customize the dialog flow as per your need by changing the dialog flow definition fields.

**Important**

* **Feedback Service** is introduced as the new **Service Type** option under **General Settings**. You can use this service to submit feedback on the surveys you may have captured using your custom flows. 

    <img src="../images/feedback-survey-dialog.png" alt="Feedback survey Dialog" title="Feedback survey Dialog" style="border:1px solid gray;zoom:70%;">

* You can invoke feedback as a sub-dialog from any other point in the conversation where you would like to capture the feedback.
