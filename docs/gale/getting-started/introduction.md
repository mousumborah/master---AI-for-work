# Introducing All-new GALE Platform

GALE is a new platform for building LLM-powered AI agents. It offers tools to create Gen AI agents quickly. These agents can easily fit into your current systems and workflows. 

You don't need to be an AI expert to use GALE. It has ready-to-use AI models and simple tools. The platform uses a drag-and-drop interface. This makes it easy to create and deploy custom AI agents. GALE offers both open-source and commercial AI models. You can fine-tune these models as needed. The platform lets you chain workflows and set up guardrails without coding. When your AI agent is ready, GALE helps you deploy it using an API.

## Key Components

Agents, Models, and Prompts are the key components of GALE that work together to enable businesses to leverage AI capabilities effectively.

=== "Agents"

    Agents allow you to create AI-powered workflows and automation with little to no coding required. Using a visual drag-and-drop interface, you can easily configure settings and combine multiple complex workflows. Guardrails ensure the models within these workflows operate responsibly, adhering to societal norms and your business requirements. The agents can seamlessly integrate with AWS, expanding the range of use cases. This user-friendly approach empowers you to leverage AI capabilities across various applications without extensive technical expertise.

=== "Models"

    Models are the core of GALE. Based on your needs, you can choose from fine-tuned, commercial, or open-source AI models. Once you've selected the right models, you can easily integrate them into your AI agents. Guardrails ensure the models generate outputs responsibly and follow defined constraints. Additionally, you can deploy these AI agents via API endpoints and integrate them with your existing systems as required.

=== "Prompts"

    GALE's Prompts Studio allows you to experiment and refine prompts to get the best performance from AI models. You can test different prompts across various models - external, fine-tuned, or open-source. It helps you identify the ideal model and configurations for each prompt through an iterative process. This streamlined workspace enables you to optimize prompts rapidly for maximum model effectiveness.
