# Add Input/Output Scanners

You can add input or output scanners to evaluate prompts or responses in your application. Input scanners assess inputs or prompts sent to the LLM node, while output scanners evaluate the responses received from the LLM.

In the following steps, you will learn how to add an input scanner. The steps to add an output scanner are similar to those for an input scanner. You need to add input and output scanners separately based on your requirements.

!!! note

    Scanners must be deployed before you add or use them. [Learn more](./manage-guardrails.md).

Steps to add a Scanner:

1. Click **Agents** on the top navigation bar and select the desired agent.

2. Click **Guardrails** in the left navigation pane. The Guardrails page is displayed.

4. Click an added scanner to configure its settings, which vary depending on the scanner type.
For example, **Toxicity** has "Threshold" and "End the flow if the risk score is above" settings, while **Regex** has "Enter patterns to ban", "End the flow if the risk score is above", and "Match type" settings.
