# Create an Agent

You can create a new agent to leverage models, build flows, and later deploy it as an endpoint. You can start the agent creation journey from the Agents page. The page also allows you to manage your existing agents and view agents that have been shared with you by others.

Steps to create an agent:

1. On the **Agents** page, click **Create new agent**. The **New agent** dialog box is displayed.
