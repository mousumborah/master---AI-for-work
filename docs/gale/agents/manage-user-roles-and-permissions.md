# Manage User Roles and Permissions

Account owners can invite users to collaborate on specific Agents. Invited users can access the Models and Data modules for the invited account but can only see the Agents they are invited to. 

!!! note

    You can only invite those users to an application, who have access to your account.

Steps to invite users to your Agent:

1. Open the Agent - click **Agents** on the top navigation bar and click the specific Agent to open it.

2. Click **Sharing & Permission** in the left navigation bar. The page lists the existing collaborators, if any.
