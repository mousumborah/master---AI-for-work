# Projects

In Evaluation Studio, projects serve as the core containers for organizing evaluations. Each project can store multiple evaluations, and each evaluation contains a distinct dataset.

Users have the flexibility to create, rename, and delete projects as needed. When a project is deleted, all associated evaluations and datasets are also removed, ensuring a clean slate.

## Creating a New Project

Steps to create a new project:

1. Navigate to Evaluation Studio.
2. On the Projects tab, click **New Project**.

3. In the **Create a new project** dialog, enter a name for the new project. Ensure the project name does not exceed the predefined character limit (e.g., 100 characters).

4. Click **Create** to submit the project creation request.
Once the project is created successfully, the system will redirect you to the newly created projectâ€™s main page.

5. On the Project page, click the three dots icon in the row of the project you want to manage for the following options:
    * **Rename**: Use this option to change the project name. 
    * **Delete**: Use this option to delete the project. A confirmation message appears, asking for confirmation to delete the project. If the user confirms, the project and all its associated datasets will be permanently deleted.

**Key Points:**

* Users can create a project, rename it, or delete it.
* Users can add evaluations under a project. When a project is deleted, all associated evaluations and datasets will be deleted as well.
* Each project has an accessible evaluation section where users can manage multiple evaluations.
