# About Playground

GALE's prompt Playground allows you to experiment and refine prompts to get the best performance from LLMs. You can test different prompts across various models - external, fine-tuned, or open-source. The Playground helps you identify each prompt's ideal model and configurations through an iterative process. This streamlined workspace enables you to optimize prompts rapidly for maximum model effectiveness.

### Key Features

* **Create a Prompt Experiment**: Create experiments by selecting a template or writing a custom prompt and adding examples. Link a dataset, add one or more LLMs to generate responses, and compare the results. [Learn more](./create-a-new-prompt-experiment.md).

* **Simple vs. Advanced Mode**: Simple mode allows quickly generating output by adding a prompt and model. Advanced mode provides more control, enabling the addition of a prompt, system prompt, and examples, linking a dataset, and adding multiple models to generate and compare outputs. [Learn more](./generate-output-using-advanced-mode.md).  

* **Reuse the Prompt Experiment**: Copy the prompt as a Gen AI node directly in the Agent Flow builder or copy it for use elsewhere. You can also export/download the prompt and related data in CSV format. [Learn more](./explore-other-actions-to-perform-in-the-prompt-playground.md#copy-a-prompt).

* **Restore a Prompt Experiment from History**: Review the timeline of prompts and their corresponding generated outputs, and restore a prompt version if needed. [Learn more](./explore-other-actions-to-perform-in-the-prompt-playground.md#restore-a-prompt-version-using-the-history).
