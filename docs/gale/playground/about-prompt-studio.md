# About Prompt Studio

GALE's enhanced Prompt Studio transforms the way you experiment with and refine prompts, enabling you to achieve the best performance from large language models (LLMs). Prompt Studio helps you manage the entire lifecycle of your prompts - from initial creation and testing to ongoing optimization. With the ability to test different prompts across various models â€” external, fine-tuned, or open-source, Prompt Studio helps you identify each prompt's ideal model and configurations through an iterative process. This streamlined workspace enables rapid optimization of prompts for maximum model effectiveness.

Additionally, with over 65 pre-built templates and powerful customization options, Prompt Studio accelerates AI agent deployment and fine-tuning, ensuring teams can quickly adapt to changing market demands. The intuitive interface and collaboration features streamline the development process, enabling efficient version management and prompt creation.
