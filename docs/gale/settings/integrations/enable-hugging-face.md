# Enable Hugging Face

GALE seamlessly integrates with the Hugging Face platform, allowing you to incorporate cutting-edge text generation and text-to-text generation models. Any publicly available Hugging Face model can be swiftly deployed via GALE with minimal effort. To utilize private or exclusive Hugging Face models, you can effortlessly establish a connection by supplying your Hugging Face access tokens. This facilitates GALE in unleashing the complete capabilities of your Hugging Face account, regardless of whether you possess public or private assets.
