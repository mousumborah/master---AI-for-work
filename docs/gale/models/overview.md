# About Models

GALE's Models Studio empowers you to enhance base models by fine-tuning them directly within the product using your enterprise's proprietary data. This allows you to create customized models tailored to your specific needs. You can also seamlessly integrate models from external sources and open-source models, expanding the range of available models to address your unique requirements.

### Key Features

* **Fine-tuned model**: Customize existing models to suit your specific requirements. [Learn more](../models/fine-tune-models/create-a-fine-tuned-model.md).

* **Open-source model**: Choose from a curated list of 30+ popular open-source models or bring in any text generation model from Hugging Face. [Learn more](../models/open-source-models/select-and-deploy-an-open-source-model.md).

* **External models**: Add commercial models like OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Cohere, and Google. You can also integrate your own hosted models into GALE using API connections. [Learn more](../models/external-models/add-an-external-model-using-easy-integration.md).

* **Quick deployment**: Deploy a model quickly in just a few steps - select the model, review parameters and hardware, and click Deploy. [Learn more](./fine-tune-models/deploy-a-fine-tuned-model.md).
