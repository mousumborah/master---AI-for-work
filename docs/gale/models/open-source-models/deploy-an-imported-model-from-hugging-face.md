# Deploy an imported model from Hugging Face

You can deploy an open-source model by selecting the Hugging Face option in the deployment process.

!!! note

    GALE currently supports models compatible with Transformers library version lower than or equal to 4.43.1. Models that require a higher version of the Transformers library cannot be supported in GALE at this time.


To deploy a model from Hugging Face, follow these steps:


1. Click **Models** on the top navigation bar of the application. The **Models** page is displayed.
2. Click the **Open-source models** tab on the **Models** page.

    * Enter the **Hugging Face model name** from Hugging Face that you wish to import and click **Next**.

1. In the **Parameters** section:

    * Select the Sampling **Temperature** to use for deployment.

    * Select the **Maximum length** which implies the maximum number of tokens to generate.

    * Select the **Top p** which is an alternative to sampling with temperature where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.

    * Select the **Top k** value which is the number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for top-k-filtering.

    * Enter the **Stop sequences** which implies that where the model will stop generating further tokens.

    * Enter the **Inference batch size** which is used to batch the concurrent requests at the time of model inferencing.

    * Select the **Min replicas** which is the minimum number of model replicas to be deployed.

    * Select the **Max replicas** which is the maximum number of model replicas to auto-scale.

    * Select the **Scale up delay (in seconds)** which is how long to wait before scaling-up replicas.

    * Select the **Scale down replicas (in seconds)** which is how long to wait before scaling down replicas.
