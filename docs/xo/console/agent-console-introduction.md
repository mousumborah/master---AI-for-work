# Introduction

The Console combines the workflows of Agents, Supervisors, and Contact Center Operations Managers. It allows them to communicate with customers, monitor operations in real-time, and access historical performance reports.

The Console allows agents to access Agent AI and execute conversational tasks. Agent AI seamlessly performs the following functions:

* Guide agents through conversations by providing response suggestions.
* Find information from an external system or knowledge base.
* Provide structured training and coaching to Agents.

## Access the Console

To access the console, follow these steps:

* Click the **Console** icon on the left panel.

The Agent Console is displayed.

The Agent Console is an agent’s primary working area consisting of the following panels:

1. The Conversation Tray
2. Incoming Interactions (Next Customer notification)
3. Live Interaction Pane
4. Additional Tools (Agent AI Widget, History, Actions, Responses, User Info). The layout and components can be customized. [Learn more](../console/manage-layout.md).

## Agent Features

The Agent Console has several primary agent features, including:

* Agent conversation tray with status-based filters, sorting, manual phone dialer, a list of conversations, and information on individual interactions.
* Incoming interaction notifications (in-app and system notifications with sound).
* Live Interaction panel for Agents and Supervisors to interact with customers. They can send attachments and secure forms, initiate an audio or video call, transfer conversations, and end interactions with a default or custom disposition code and closing remarks.
* Customer information, including interaction history and access to previous conversations.
* Agent assistance, including auto-suggested actions and responses, response history, and the ability to browse and use predefined, standard responses.
* Integration with third-party sites or systems via widgets displayed within the console.
* Customizable layout via [Manage Layout](../console/manage-layout.md).

## Supervisor Features

The console offers several features that enable contact center supervisors to monitor agent activity, including:

* **Activity view by Agent**: Supervisors can view all agent activities, such as load percentages, queues, average times, and other efficiency metrics.
* **Activity view by Skill**: Supervisors can view agent skill points, such as overdue, ongoing, idle, expired, completed, transferred, dropped-off, total conversations, average handle time, and active and queued customers.
* **Agent Console View**: Supervisors can access the agent view on their console and perform actions.
* **Context Chat**: Supervisors can chat with a peer supervisor for a customer context and provide quick assistance.
* **Conference**: Supervisors can join a conference or group chat to have multiple agents assist customers in real-time.
* **Take Over**: Supervisors can take over an agent’s conversation with a customer to improve response.
