# Conversation Tray

The conversation tray helps agents track their workload by displaying all conversations that are currently assigned to them.

## Conversation Status

The conversation tray divides conversations into different statuses, which are displayed at the top. Conversations can have any of the following four statuses:

* **Overdue**: These are conversations where the agent has not responded to the customer within the system-specified time.
* **Ongoing**: These are conversations where the last sent or received message was within the system-specified time.
* **Idle**: These are conversations where the last message was sent or received more than the system-specified time ago.
* **After Call Work (ACW)**: ACW refers to the post-call tasks or activities that agents perform immediately after ending a conversation with a customer.

## Color Codes

Color codes help in easy identification and better readability of conversations on digital channels.

* The blue dot represents a conversation in which an agent is engaged.
