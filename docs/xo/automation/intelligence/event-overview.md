# Events

Events are triggered when specific actions occur during a conversation with the Virtual Assistant  or when specific events are triggered on any active channels.

To access **Events**, navigate to **Automation AI > Virtual Assistant > Conversation Intelligence > Events**.

## Event Actions

Developers can define what action the VA should take when an event is triggered using one of the following options:

### Initiate a Task

Select a Dialog task (Standard or Hidden) to be invoked when the event triggers. Once the event is triggered, the dialog starts executing. If it is interrupted by other intent detections, the Hold and Resume settings come into play. During execution, the event is discarded if the selected Dialog is not published in the VA.

In some cases, the Dialog may not be available to the user during a conversation for various reasons, such as the task not being published, suspended, or simply not having been assigned to the user. In such cases, the VA shows an error message that the task is not currently available for execution.

Developers can preempt such situations by testing the VA in Debug mode. The Debug Console shows full details about the error, including why the task is not available.

### Run a Script

Define a JavaScript to run when the event triggers. The script can use all applicable components, such as session, context objects, variables, and functions. You can also fix the code using the Debug mode.

### Show a Message

When the event triggers, define a simple or advanced message for the user. It supports all messaging formatting features available in the XO Platform, including multiple messages with channel override options.

#### Multilingual VA Behavior for Messages

* You can define language-specific messages;
* If a message is deleted from an Event for a specific language, then it will be removed from all other languages of the VA;
* If a message is added for a language, then the message would be added in all other languages using the same content;
* If a message is modified in a language, the modifications will be applied only to that language. [Learn more](../../sdk/web-mobile-sdk-message-formatting-and-templates.md).

## Event Types

Events are classified as **Intent Events**, **Conversation Events**, and **Sentiment Events**.

You can configure the following events to trigger responses:

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Intent not Identified

  <tr>
   <td>Ambiguous Intents Identified

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Task Execution Failure
