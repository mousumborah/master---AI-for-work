# Import and Export a Knowledge Graph

You can build a Knowledge Graph in a CSV or JSON file and upload it to a VA. Similarly, you can export the existing Knowledge Graph to CSV or JSON. Exporting a Knowledge Graph helps you edit it in a spreadsheet or import it to another VA.

The allowed limit is a maximum of 50k FAQs spread across a maximum of 20k nodes.

The XO Platform allows you to import any VA with a file size up to 50MB. If you try to import a bot with more than 50MB size, the import process fails.
