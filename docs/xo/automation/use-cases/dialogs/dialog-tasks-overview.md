# Dialog Tasks Overview

Dialog Tasks represent a core component of the XO Platform. Together with the [Conversation Designer](../../../../app-settings/the-conversation-designer/){:target="_blank"}, it is an essential tool in building conversations connected to your business logic.

Each task comprises interlinked [nodes ](../node-types/nodes-transitions/){:target="_blank"}that help retrieve information, perform actions, connect with external apps, send messages to users, and more.

To learn more and start creating your own Dialog Tasks, first learn how to [Navigate the Dialog Builder](../navigating-dialog-tasks/){:target="_blank"} and then how to [Work with Dialog Tasks](../using-the-dialog-builder-tool/){:target="_blank"}.

While working with Dialog Tasks, you will be interacting with a variety of related features, including:

* [Sub-intent management & Node Grouping ](../node-connections/grouping-nodes){:target="_blank"}– You can configure sub-intents within a task using group nodes or configure a task as a subintent.
* [Component Transitions ](../node-types/nodes-transitions/#component-transitions){:target="_blank"}– Each node can be configured to connect to other nodes according to specific if-else conditions that you can customize based on various criteria.
* [Voice and IVR integration](../node-types/voice-call-properties/){:target="_blank"} – Relevant nodes can be integrated with voice and IVR tools to assist your users via voice.
* [User and Error Prompt management](../prompt-editor/){:target="_blank"} – Task nodes allow you to customize the messaging users see when interacting with that node or when there is an error.
* [The Context Object ](../../../intelligence/context-object/){:target="_blank"}– You can use the Context Object as a container for data that can be used across tasks, intents, and FAQs.
