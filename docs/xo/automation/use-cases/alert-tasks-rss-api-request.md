# Alert Task – RSS API Request

We have seen how an Alert task can be set up in the  XO Platform <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/automation/use-cases/alert-tasks/" target="_blank">here</a>. In this section, we will see how to configure an API Request for a RSS service.

<img src="../images/rss-api-request.png" alt="rss api request" title="rss api request" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

For a task with the **Connection Type** specified as **Webservice** and the **Connection Mode** set to **RSS** you need to define:

* **Content Type** – The type of data exchanged between the XO Platform and your web application,
* **Authentication** – If required for your alert task, you will need to define the authentication to access the API, for example, using basic authorization, OAuth, or API Key. <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/automation/use-cases/alert-tasks/#authorization" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
* **Parameters** – Define one or more parameters used to process the API request, for example, input from user prompts, selection by an end-user from a list of choices, a URL, and so forth. <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/automation/use-cases/alert-tasks-rss-api-request/#define-parameters" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
* **Initializer** – Specify custom JavaScript to run, or set session variables prior to creating a task instance when web services require code to be executed, or session variables set, or modification of user context details before an API request is executed. <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/automation/use-cases/alert-tasks-rss-api-request/#define-an-initializer" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
* **Request** – Define a request chain used to make an API call to a web service to initiate the task using URLs and paths to your VA to initiate the delivery of the data payload from the web service to the XO Platform. The request chain can consist of pre-processors, API requests, and post-processors. <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/automation/use-cases/alert-tasks-rss-api-request/#define-the-request-chain" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
* **Response Sample** – Define key/value pairs that you expect to receive in the task payload. The keys that you provide are available as drop-down choices for handling the data to display to the end-user. <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/automation/use-cases/alert-tasks-rss-api-request/#add-the-response-sample" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.
* **Preview Website Link Content in Post** – The website preview content displayed in the task notification message. <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/automation/use-cases/alert-tasks-rss-api-request/#website-preview-content" target="_blank">Learn more</a>.

## Define the Content Type

The **Content Type** describes the type of data exchanged between Kore.ai and your website or application, and the key-value pairs expected in the task payload response.
<img src="../images/define-content-type.png" alt="define content type" title="define content type" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

To define the Content Type for the API Request (RSS), expand the **Content Type** tab and select one of these options:

* **JSON** – JavaScript Object Notation is an open standard format using human-readable text to transmit data objects as attribute-value pairs. You can use JSON to transmit data between the Kore.ai servers and your web application.
* **RSS** – Rich Site Summary, or Really Simple Syndication, is a family of standardized formats used to publish frequently updated information such as blog entries, news headlines, audio, and video.
* **XML** – Extensible Markup Language is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Oftentimes, web services use XML schemas to process the XML data.
* **URL Encoded JSON** – URLs using JSON encoding for reserved characters.
* **CSV** – Comma-separated value lists.
* **Text** – Text-based key-value pairs.
* **Twitter Encoded JSON** – URLs for Twitter using JSON encoding for reserved characters.
* **Multipart/Form-data** – An encoding type that allows files to be sent through an HTTP POST request method if you want to allow a user to upload a file from a form.
* **Multipart/Related** – Used when the same information is presented in different body parts in different forms. The body parts are ordered by increasing complexity.
* **Oracle ADF** – For Oracle Application Development Framework.

## Define Parameters

Follow these steps to define the API Request (REST) parameters:

1. Expand the **Parameters** section, and then click **Create Parameter**.

## Define an Initializer

To run a task, you may need to put or get values from a session before executing the task using session-specific variables. For more information, see <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/automation/use-cases/using-session-and-context-variables/" target="_blank">Using Session and Context Variables in Tasks</a>. 

Some web services require executed code, session variables, or modification of user context details before executing an API request. For example, a web service may require two-factor user authorization where the first step is a user log in, and the second step is a partner authorization. After validating both these steps, an access token is granted and used in the header of subsequent API calls to that web service. 

Using the **Initializer**, you can complete partner authorization and retrieve the access token from the response of the user authentication. The access token can be stored as a custom session variable and set as the header for subsequent API calls.

To configure the task initializer, click the **Initializer** tab. It opens a JavaScript editor in which you can write the required code.

<img src="../images/define-and-initializer.png" alt="define am initializer" title="define am initializer" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

In the JavaScript editor, define the **Key** and the **Scope** as follows:

**EnterpriseContext** – A key-value pair available to all VAs and all users in an enterprise. For example, for a GitHub VA, a user needs to access one or more enterprise repositories. In the **Initializer**, you can persist the repository data as **Gitrepository (Enterprise Context)** with the following JavaScript code:

```js
var userRepository = {
"title": _labels_[repository],
"value": repository
};
EnterpriseContext.put('Gitrepository', userRepository, 200000);
```

**BotContext** – A key-value pair available to all users of this specific VA. For example, you may want to set up a default currency for financial transactions in a session based on the user location. In the **Initializer**, you can persist the default currency data as **currency (Bot Context)** with the following JavaScript code:

```js
var defaultCurrency = { TODO Custom JavaScript for location-based currency }
BotContext.put('currency', defaultCurrency, 200000);
```

**UserContext** – A key-value pair available to all VAsfor a user. These keys are read-only and provided by the system as user data for:

* **id** – The Kore.ai userId.
* **emailId** – The email address associated with the userId.
* **lastName** – The last name of the user.
* **firstName** – The first name of the user.
* **profImage** – The image or avatar filename of the user.
* **profColour** – The account color for the user.
* **activationStatus** – The account status of the user.
* **title** – The title of the user, if defined.
* **orgId** – The organizational ID of the user account, if defined.

**UserSession** – Define a key-value pair available for this specific user for all VAsin an enterprise. For example, you may want to store a user location to make it available to all VAs, such as a user home address for commerce, transportation, and home delivery services. In the **Initializer**, you can persist the default location data as **HomeLocation (UserSession)** with the following JavaScript code:

```js
var location = {
 "title": labels[location],
 "value": {
 "latitude": location.latitude,
 "longitude": request.location.longitude
 }
};
UserSession.put('HomeLocation', location, '20000');
```

**BotUserSession** – Define a key-value pair available to a specific VA based on a specific user’s inputs. For example, you may want to persist in a user location for more than one VA task. For a travel VA, the user may be able to book a flight and a hotel based on the same home and destination addresses. 

In the **Initializer**, you can persist the default home and destination data as **HomeLocation (BotUserSession)** and **DestinationLocation (BotUserSession)** with the following JavaScript code:


```js
var homelocation = {
 "title": labels[request.sourceLocation],
 "value": {
 "latitude": request.sourceLocation.latitude,
 "longitude": request.sourceLocation.longitude
 }
};
BotUserSession.put('HomeLocation', homelocation, '20000');
var destlocation = {
 "title": labels[request.destLocation],
 "value": {
 "latitude": request.destLocation.latitude,
 "longitude": request.destLocation.longitude
 }
};
BotUserSession.put('DestinationLocation', destlocation, '20000');
```

### GET and PUT Syntax

The following code examples show the syntax to GET or PUT a key-value pair for each context type.

```js
"EnterpriseContext" :
"get" : function(key){...},//get the specified key
"put" : function(key, value, ttl){...} //put the value at the key for the specified ttl,
ttl is in minutes
},
"BotContext" : {
"get" : function(key){...},//get the specified key
"put" : function(key, value, ttl){...} //put the value at the key for the specified ttl, ttl is in minutes
},
"UserContext" : {
"get" : function(key){...},//get the specified key
},
"UserSession" : {
"get" : function(key){...},//get the specified key
"put" : function(key, value, ttl){...} //put the value at the key for the specified ttl, ttl is in minutes
 
```

For example:

```js
BotContext.put("topicSessionVariable","music",2000);
UserSession.put("firstName","Mary",20000);
UserContext.get("firstName");
```

### Exception Syntax

You can also define custom error messages to catch errors before setting up a task, for example, authentication failure. 

If an exception is captured, the task setup is halted. Use the following syntax to throw the exception:

```js
{
"exceptions": {
"message": " Error Message"
}
}
```

For example:

```js
var ex ={};
var exceptions={};
exceptions.message ='You cannot proceed further without valid permissions';
ex.exceptions = exceptions;
print(JSON.stringify(ex)); //print is mandatory.
```

In the **Initializer** section, you can use session **Keys**, or other session variables, however, you cannot set or access values. For example,

```js
var name = UserContext.get("firstName")+UserContext.get("lastName");
UserSession.put("fullName") = name;
```

In the preceding code example, you PUT a value into the session using a task **Parameter** defined with the **Fetch from Session** field in the **Advanced Settings** section for the task. 

The **Key** is defined as `fullName` for the custom defined `UserSession` context variable.

### Task Initializer Example

The following code is an example of a **Task Initializer** to get the user ID and email data to pre-populate variables in the API request. 


```js
var x = UserContext.get("identities");
var isEmailFound = false;
for (var i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
if (x[i].type === "mapped") {
var identity = x[i].val
var arr = identity.split("/");
var pattern = /^cs/i;
var result = arr[0].match(pattern);
if (result) {
isEmailFound = true;
UserSession.put("rtmEmail", arr[1], '20000');
}
}
}
if (!isEmailFound) {
for (var j = 0; j < x.length; j++) {
if (x[j].type === "email") {
UserSession.put("rtmEmail", x[j].val, '20000');
}
}
}
```

## Define the Request Chain

In the Request section of the API Request tab, you can define an API request chain consisting of preprocessors, API Requests, and postprocessors. At least one API Request is required, while processors are optional.

### API Request

For any task, you will need to define an API request to make a call to a web service to initiate the task. At least one API request is required for each task. For each API request, you must add one or more request URLs and paths to your task to initiate the delivery of the data payload from the web service.

### Configure the API Request

1. On the **API Request** tab, expand the **Request** section, and then click, **Add API**.
<img src="../images/api-request-add.png" alt="add api request" title="add api request" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

2. Specify the values for the fields in the **Add API** dialog.
<img src="../images/add-api-dialog.png" alt="add api dialog" title="add api dialog" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

3. In the **Name** field, enter the name of your API request, for example, _My API Request_.
4. In the **Method** drop-down list, select the HTTP method used for the task:

    * **GET** – Returns the content of an existing target resource.
    * **POST**– Used to send data to the server such as customer information, file upload, using HTML forms.
    * **PUT**– Replaces the content of the target resource with the content sent.
    * **PATCH** – Appends the content of an existing target resource with the content sent.
    * **DELETE** – Deletes the content of an existing target resource.
5. In the **URL** field, specify the URL for the VA task response to the process. For example, `http://koremessenger.com/postURL`. You can also use session variables in the URL as shown in the following example: 
`https://mySite.crm.ondemand.com/sap/c4c/odata/v1/c4codata/ServiceRequestCollection?$filter=ID eq '{id}' and ReporterEmail eq '{userEmail}'&amp;$expand=ServiceRequestHistoricalVersion,ServiceRequestDescription`

6. In the **Access Using A Connector** field, select **Yes** to enable access for the VA using the Kore.ai Connector agent. This option is only visible if a Kore.ai Connector agent is configured and enabled in your enterprise on-premises network. For more information, see <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/administration/kore-ai-connector/" target="_blank">Using the Kore.ai Connector</a>.
7. On the **Headers** tab, in the **Content Type** field, select one of the following supported data types for your sample response data.
    * **JSON** – JavaScript Object Notation is an open standard format using human-readable text to transmit data objects as attribute-value pairs. You can use JSON to transmit data between the Kore.ai servers and your web application.

10. Click **Save** to save and close the API Request configuration.

### Processors

Processors allow you to manipulate data collected in the user session before, during, or after an API request to a web service using JavaScript.

If you define and place a processor before the API Request, it is a preprocessor. Preprocessors allow you to manage input parameters and values from session variables before the API Request is made.

If the processor is sequentially placed after the API Request, it is a postprocessor. You can use a postprocessor to access payload response keys from the API request. To access keys, use one of the following post-processor types:

* **Resolve**: To use the results of one payload response as input for a second request.
* **Spread** – To separate arrays of data in a payload.
* **Extract** – To specify a path to a specific object in a payload with multiple objects.
* **Assign** – To specify a variable name for the payload response.

#### Preprocessors

You can use a preprocessor to manage request parameters before the API Request is executed, using session variables and parameters. When defining a pre-processor, you must set **Type of Process** to **custom** and then enter your code in the JavaScript editor displayed. A preprocessor can only be of **Type custom**.

##### Add a Pre-Processor

1. On the **API Request** page, expand the **Request** tab, and then click **Add Processor**.
<img src="../images/add-pre-processor-rss.png" alt="add pre processor" title="add pre processor" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

2. Enter the name of your processor in the **Name** field.
3. In the **Type of Process** drop-down list, you must select **Custom** for a pre-processor.
4. Add your code for manipulating the request parameters as needed using the following syntax:

```js
{
"fields": {
"payloadFields": { // to set value to a payload field
"key1": "value1", // Payload fields are not applicable for Alert tasks.
"key2": "value2"....
},
"headerFields": { // to set value to a header field
"key1": "value1",
"key2": "value2"....
},
"pathFields": { // to set value to a path field or query field.
"key1": "value1",
"key2": "value2"....
}
}
}
```

For example, the following code snippet can be used to set the path field or the query field of an API object:

```js
var fields= {};
var pathFields = {};
pathFields.fullName = UserContext.get("firstName")+UserContext.get("lastName")
fields.pathFields = pathFields;
var finalObject = {};
finalObject.fields = fields;
print(JSON.stringify(finalObject));
```

In the previous code, if **firstName** and **lastName** are stored as session variables, as <i>John</i> and <i>Smith</i> respectively, then the JSON response payload from the pre-processor would be:

```js
{
fields: {
"pathFields": {
"key": "fullName",
"value": "John Smith"
}
}
}
```

In the following preprocessor example, variables are set with session variables prior to the actual API request call.

```js
var fields = {};
var pathFields = {};
var UserEmailID = UserSession.get("rtmEmail");
pathFields.userEmail = UserEmailID;
fields.pathFields = pathFields;
var finalObject = {};
finalObject.fields = fields;
print(JSON.stringify(finalObject));
```

When you are ready, click **Save** to save and close the **Add Processor** dialog.

#### Postprocessors

##### Add a Postprocessor

You may need more than one API request to get the desired data payload from your web service, using Kore.ai post-processors.

##### Define a Custom Post-Processor

If you want to create a custom post-processor, you could access the response keys of the previous API Request using the following syntax:

`payload[0].{ key }`

**JSON Syntax**

```js
{
 "payload":
{
"key1" : "value1",
"key2" : "value2"
}
}
```

**Example**

```js
var final = {};
var data = payload[0]; //Accessing the response of the previous API object
data.title[0] = 'New value for key here';
final.payload = data; // Updating the response of the API object
print(JSON.stringify(final)); // This step is mandatory.
```

For custom processors, you must print the final response as shown in the preceding code, otherwise, an empty response is returned. Use the following syntax:


```js
print(JSON.stringify( <<-object->> ));
```

##### Configure Standard Post-processors

Follow these steps to add a standard postprocessor:

1. On the **API Request** tab, expand the **Request** tab, and then click **Add Processor**.
2. Kore.ai also provides a set of standard post-processors that you can use instead of creating custom code for a post-processor. In **Type of Process** field, select one of the following four types of standard processors:

    **Resolve**: You can use the results of one payload response as input for a second request. For example, click **Add Processor**, enter a **Name** for your processor, set **Type of Process** to **resolve**, and **Key** to the name of the variable, and then define the **Post URL** using a variable from the first API Request. For example, https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects/**{project_id}** that returns the id field in the payload response as: 

```js
"id":80468818418144, <br/>
"created_at":"2016-01-14T05:34:35.848Z",
"modified_at":"2016-01-20T04:29:52.505Z",
"owner":{
"id":73114591129714,
"name":"jaganmohan.evuri" },
```

<ol start="3"><li><p>It is then used as a variable input as shown in the following <b>Post URL:</b></p> 
<p><code>https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects/<b>{id}</b>/tasks?opt_fields=completed,modified_at</code>
You must also specify the HTML <b>Content Type</b> expected in the payload response as well as the HTML <b>Request</b> method. For more information, see <a href="https://docsinternal-kore.github.io/docs/xo/automation/use-cases/using-session-and-context-variables/" target="_blank">Using Session and Context Variables in Tasks</a>.</p></li>

<ul><li><b>Spread</b>: For payloads that contain arrays of data that you need to separate. For example, click <b>Add Processor</b>, enter a <b>Name</b> for your processor, set the <b>Key</b> field to, for example, <b>data</b>, and <b>Type of Process</b> to <b>spread</b> to capture the content in the data element in the following code example to extract each item of the array.

<li><b>Extract</b>: For payloads that contain multiple objects, you can specify a path to the specific object.

For example, click <b>Add Processor</b>, enter a <b>Name</b> for your processor, set the <b>Key</b> field to data, and then <b>Type of Process</b> to <b>extract</b> to use the object data in the following payload response.

```js
{
"user": {
"full_name": "Kore.ai Hyd",
"id": "2056218675",
"profile_picture": "https://instagramimages-a.akamaihd.net/profiles/anonymousUser.jpg",

}
},
}
```
</li>

<li><b>Assign</b>: Using the <b>Assign</b> processor, you can specify a variable name for the payload response, if needed, for example, when the payload does not contain a key for the payload response data. 

For example, set <b>Type of Process</b> to assign, and then in the <b>Output Variable</b> field, you can for example, define an output variable for the following payload that is an array of three objects.

```js

## Add the Response Sample

In the **Response Sample** section, you can enter or paste examples of the key-value pairs that you expect to receive in the task payload. 

When you define the response sample, the keys specified in the **Response Sample** section are available as drop-down choices for handling the output data.

To add a sample response, follow the steps below:

1. On the **API Request** tab, Expand the **Sample Response** section.
2. Enter your Response Sample that contains the key-value pairs from your JSON response payload. Do one of the following:

   * To format the view of the response as a JSON structure with indentation as shown in the following illustration, click the **Formatted** icon.
   * To format the view of the response in serialized compact form as shown in the following illustration, click the **Unformatted** icon.
  <img src="../images/response-sample-rss.png" alt="response sample rss" title="response sample rss" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">
 
## Website Preview Content

Some web services send links to preview media as part of the payload response. In this section, you can enable or disable preview links, and define the path to the links in the payload. By default, website preview links are disabled. The following illustration is an example of the **Preview Website Link Content in Post** section, when **Yes** is selected.
<img src="../images/preview-website-rss.png" alt="preview website" title="preview website" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:75%;">

When enabled, define the path to the preview links in the payload in the **Path to the Link (toPreview)** field, if the path is not in the root of the payload. For example, in the following code example from an RSS payload, the path to the preview is given by <i>link</i>.

```js
"item": [
    {
        "title": "U.S. to Boost Refugee Intake by 30,000 by 2017",
        "guid": {
            "-isPermaLink": "false",
            "#text": "SB12418904751422433479504581245034032986752"
        },
        "link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/john-kerry-says-u-s-to-admit-30-000-more-refugees-in-next-2-years-1442768498?mod=fox_australian",
```

When **Preview website link content in Post** is enabled, select preview objects such as:

* **Preview Title** – Displays the title of the website content.
* **Preview Description** – Displays the description of the website content.
* **Preview Media(Video)** – Enables display of video links from the website content.
* **Preview Media(Image)** – Enables display of image links from the website content.
