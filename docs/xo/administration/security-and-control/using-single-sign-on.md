# Using Single Sign-On

On the Kore.ai **Single Sign-On** page, in the **Security & Control** module of the Bots Admin Console, you can configure Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for your Kore.ai managed users using the following:

* OpenID Connect
* Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
* WS-Federation sign-on protocol.

SSO enables easy access to the Kore.ai application using your existing identity provider. With SSO, your users can log on once, for example, to your company account, and when accessing their Kore.ai application, the same login credentials can be used automatically by the system.

For example, using the _WS-Federation_ sign-on protocol, you can enable a user to sign on to the Kore.ai application using Microsoft® Active Directory® server credentials.

The following illustration shows the **Single Sign-On** page in the Bots Admin Console **Security & Control** module.

## Enable or Disable SSO

Depending on the security required for your company, you can enable or disable Single Sign-On (SSO) for users accessing the Kore.ai application.

When you disable SSO or when the SSO authentication validity period expires, users must create and log on using their credentials. If no account specific password policies have been defined, then default Kore.ai password policies are automatically enabled for the users.

**To enable Single Sign-On**

* In the **Security & Control** module, on the **Single Sign On** page, click **Enable SSO**.

## OpenID Connect

Complete the steps in the following procedure to configure SSO using Open ID Connect protocol in the **Security & Control** module of the Bots Admin Console. Kore.ai also supports WS-Federation and SAML Connect protocols.

1. In the **Security & Control** module on the **Single Sign On** page in the Bots Admin Console, click **Enable SSO**.
2. In the **Select suitable Sign-On Protocol** section, select **OpenID Connect**.
3. In the **Configure SSO for OpenID Connect** section, select an identity provider, for example, **Sign in with Google**.
4. Click **Save**.
5. The _Identity Provider information successfully updated_ message is displayed at the top of the page.


## WS-Federation

Complete the steps in the following procedure to configure Single Sign-On (SSO) using the WS-Federation protocol in the **Security & Control** module of the Bots Admin Console.



1. In the **Security & Control** module on the **Single Sign On** page in the Bots Admin Console, click **Enable SSO**.
2. In the **Select suitable Sign-On Protocol** section, select **WS-Federation**.
3. In the **Configure SSO for WS-Federation** section, select an identity provider, and then define the settings for:
    1. **Windows Azure®**
        * **Azure AD Sign-On End Point URL** – The URL that Kore.ai sends sign on and sign off requests using _Azure_. The response for the authentication is sent to the **Reply URL** defined in your _Azure_ Active Directory configuration settings.
        * **Azure AD Federation Metadata Document** – The URL for the federation metadata document used for authentication with _Azure_ Active Directory.
    2. **Other** – Generic WS-Federation identity provider configuration, other than Azure
        * **AD Sign-On End Point URL** – The URL that Kore.ai sends sign on and sign off requests using your WS-Federation identity provider.
        * **AD Federation Metadata Document URL** – The URL for the WS-Federation metadata document used for authentication with Active Directory.

4. In the administrative console for your Single Sign-On provider, you will also need to define the URLs that are used to exchange data between Kore.ai and your SSO provider. While the URL names may vary by SSO provider, you will need to define these URLs:
    1. **SAML 2.0**
        * **LDAP Attribute:** nameId
        * **Claim Attribute:** uri

    2. **SAML 1.1**
        * **LDAP Attribute:** nameId
        * **Claim Attribute:** emailAddress

    3. **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** or **Callback URL** as [https://idp.kore.com/authorize/callback](https://idp.kore.com/authorize/callback?__hstc=59894770.e90bc57a4e2025da994552ad13bbab05.1699003492940.1701937564529.1701950143315.124&__hssc=59894770.1.1701950143315&__hsfp=4271746649){:target="_blank"}.
    
5. In addition to authentication values, you must pass the email address of the user as an LDAP attribute from Active Directory when using ADFS. For more information, [see Attributes for ADFS](#attributes-for-adfs).
6. Click **Save**.

The _Identity Provider information successfully updated_ message is displayed at the top of the page.


## SAML

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a standard protocol for web browser Single Sign-On (SSO) using secure tokens. SAML completely eliminates all passwords and instead uses standard cryptography and digital signatures to pass a secure sign-in token from an identity provider to a SaaS application.

SAML provides a solution to allow your identity provider and service providers to exist separately from each other. When a user logs into a SAML-enabled application, the service provider requests authorization from the appropriate identity provider. The identity provider authenticates the user’s credentials and then returns the authorization for the user to the service provider, and the user is now able to use the application.


### How SAML works

SAML SSO works by transferring the user’s identity from one place (the identity provider) to another (the service provider). This is done through an exchange of digitally signed XML documents.

Consider the following scenario: A user is logged into a system that acts as an identity provider. The user wants to log in to a remote application, such as a support or accounting application (the service provider). The following happens:



1. The user accesses the remote application using a link on an intranet, a bookmark, or similar and the application loads.
2. The application identifies the user’s origin (by application subdomain, user IP address, or similar) and redirects the user back to the identity provider, asking for authentication. This is the authentication request.
3. The user either has an existing active browser session with the identity provider or establishes one by logging into the identity provider.
4. The identity provider builds the authentication response in the form of an XML-document containing the user’s username or email address, signs it using an X.509 certificate, and posts this information to the service provider.
5. The service provider, which already knows the identity provider and has a certificate fingerprint, retrieves the authentication response and validates it using the certificate fingerprint.
6. The identity of the user is established and the user is provided with app access.


### Kore.ai Implementation

There are two ways SAML can be used within XO Platform:



* For developer authentication to access the Bot Builder,
* For user authentication to access the Bot.


#### Use case 1: Bot builder authentication.

Enterprises can set up access to the Bot builder tool using the enterprise SSO. Bot developers and admins can log into bot builder using SSO done by the enterprise identity provider.

**SSO flow from XO Platform**: The following is the flow within the XO Platform once SSO is configured using SAML:



1. The client makes a call to Kore app server (using the login URL) with user details to get identity provider info (SAML).
2. Kore app server initiates a handshake request with the Kore idproxy server.
3. Kore idproxy server initiates a request to the identity provider (SAML) with user details.
4. On successful authentication, the identity provider (SAML) returns an assertion response to the Kore idproxy server.
5. Upon verifying the response from the identity provider, Kore idproxy server initiates a request to the Kore app server.
6. On successful authentication of the token from Kore idproxy server, Kore app server grants access to the user.

Post v7.2 release, Kore.ai supports the IDP initiated flow, wherein the platform gets the postback directly with SAML response and is able to validate the assertion and register/identify the user. The configuration for these modes – SP-based and IDP-based flow is different and is highlighted in the configuration steps below.

Refer below [to configure SSO using SAML](#configuring-sso-using-saml)


#### Use case 2: End-user authentication

In this scenario, the bot chat interface is embedded on the customer portal or Mobile app that requires user authentication via SSO.  
The Bot access is automatically limited to authenticated users.  If the task requires API invocation that requires SSO based authentication the developer can follow the below steps

* On the client, developer needs to retrieve SSO token of the logged in user and pass it to the bot using the **_secureCustomPayload_** parameter in the Bot SDK API.
* In the dialog task, Bot developer can write custom logic to read this token and add it as API headers for secure API calls made using service node or webhook node.

The token information on the client varies depending upon the SSO provider and the payload, accordingly the developer would need to write custom logic.


### Configuring SSO using SAML

Complete the following steps to configure Single Sign-On (SSO) using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol in the Kore.ai Bots Admin Console. Kore.ai also supports WS-Federation and OpenID Connect protocols. For more information, see [Using Single Sign-On](../using-single-sign-on/){:target="_blank"}.


### OKTA Configuration

1. In the **Security & Control** module on the **Single Sign On** page in the Bots Admin Console, click **Enable SSO**.
2. In the **Select a suitable Sign-On Protocol** section, select **SAML**.
3. In the **Configure SSO for SAML** section, select an identity provider, and then define the settings for one of:
    1. **Okta Single Sign-On URL** – The SSO URL for _Okta_ this is to enable Service Provider initiated SAML flow.
    2. **Identity Provider Issuer** – The entity that provides the user identities including the ability to authenticate a user.
    3. **Certificate** – The public certificate stored by the service provider from the identity provider used to validate a user signature. You can add multiple (max of 2) certificates, delete already added invalid certificates, platform will use the latest certificate for authorization, in case it is invalid then the older certificate would be used.
    4. **ACS URL for SP Initiated SAML Flow** – This is the redirect URL for Service Provided initiated SAML flow.
    5. **ACS URL for IDP Initiated SAML Flow** – This is the account-specific URL for Identity Provided initiated SAML flow.
    6. **SAML Attribute Mapping** – Enable this option to map SAML Attributes with Kore.ai Group Names or Admin Roles Names. Once enabled, you can:
        * define how the SAML attributes should be mapped with Kore.ai attributes:
            1. Full Sync – Every time the user signs in, the platform will update the user’s Group and Role assignments based on the SAML Attributes present in the response. All existing assignments will be removed. Only the new group or role assignments as available in the SAML response will be assigned
            2. Inclusion Only – Every time the user signs in, the platform will only assign the new group or roles available in the SAML response. All existing assignments will be retained. New assignments will be added as available in the SAML responses

        * define one or more mapping pairs. Each pair includes
            1. SAML Attribute Name – Name of the SAML attribute as available in the SAML response
            2. SAML Attribute Value – Value associated with the SAML attribute

            * Admin Roles defined in the Kore.ai account
            * Bot Builder Access
            * New Bot Creation
            * Manage Data Tables and Views

        * Kore.ai Attribute – Refers to either Group Name or Role Name. The list should include the following:
            * List of all Admin Roles
            * Bot Builder Access
            * New Bot Creation
            * Manage Data Tables and Views

    * In the administrative console for your Single Sign-On provider, you will also need to define the URLs that are used to exchange data between Kore.ai and your SSO provider. While the URL names may vary by SSO provider, you will need to define these URLs:
        * **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** or **Callback URL** as [https://idp.kore.com/authorize/callback.](https://idp.kore.com/authorize/callback?__hstc=59894770.e90bc57a4e2025da994552ad13bbab05.1699003492940.1701937564529.1701950143315.124&__hssc=59894770.1.1701950143315&__hsfp=4271746649){:target="_blank"}
        * In addition to authentication values, you must pass the email address of the user as an LDAP attribute from Active Directory when using ADFS. For more information, see [Attributes for ADFS](#attributes-for-adfs).
        * **Identity URL** or **Sign On URL** as [https://idp.kore.com](https://idp.kore.com/?__hstc=59894770.e90bc57a4e2025da994552ad13bbab05.1699003492940.1701937564529.1701950143315.124&__hssc=59894770.1.1701950143315&__hsfp=4271746649){:target="_blank"}

* Click **Save**.

The _Identity Provider information successfully updated_ message is displayed at the top of the page.


#### Attributes for ADFS

When you configure Single Sign-On using LDAP for ADFS, in addition to authentication attributes, your third-party SSO provider can send additional attributes to Kore.ai through the **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** or **Callback URL**.

If you are using a built-in Kore.ai app for SSO, such as _Windows Azure_ for WS-Federation protocol, or _OneLogin_ for SAML protocol, required attributes are already configured for Kore.ai when you add the Kore.ai app to your SSO provider admin console.

The following data is an example of attribute data passed to Kore.ai in the callback URL.

```
<Attribute Name="FirstName" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri" FriendlyName="First Name">
<AttributeValue>Michael</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
<Attribute Name="LastName" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri" FriendlyName="Last Name">
<AttributeValue>Mehra</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
<Attribute Name="DisplayName" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri" FriendlyName="Display Name">
<AttributeValue>Michael Mehra</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
<Attribute Name="EmailAddress" NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri" FriendlyName="Email">
<AttributeValue>michael.mehra@acme.com</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
```

These attributes are optional except for the `EmailAddress`, which is required. The `Email Address` attribute uses the following `nameId` format:

```
SAML 2.0:
NameID Format="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri"
SAML 1.1:
NameID Format="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid:format:emailAddress
```

#### Mapping Attributes in ADFS

ADFS is a service provided by Microsoft as a standard role for Windows Server that provides a web login using existing Active Directory credentials. When using SAML or WS-Federation protocols to log on with ADFS, you can pass other values in addition to the authentication values.

The attribute values are defined as **Claim Rules** in the **Relying Party Trust** dialog in the SQL Server admin console. To edit the **Claim Rules**, select the **Relying Party Trusts** folder in **ADFS Management**, and then click **Edit Claim Rules** from the **Actions** sidebar. To add a new rule, click **Add Rule**, and then select the **Send LDAP Attributes** template. Enter the following mapping values:

* **SAML 2.0**
    * **LDAP Attribute:** nameId
    * **Claim Attribute:** uri

* **SAML 1.1**
    * **LDAP Attribute:** nameId
    * **Claim Attribute:** emailAddress


## Logging On Using Your Admin Password Instead of SSO

As an Bots Admin, you can enable Single Sign-On (SSO) using a third-party security system, for example, _Google_. If for some reason, your SSO security system fails, or you forget your SSO log on credentials for your third-party security system, you can still log on to the Kore.ai Bots Admin Console and bypass SSO.

A Bots Admin with a custom admin role can only bypass SSO and use their admin password if custom privileges are enabled for at least one module. To log on to the Kore.ai Directory Agent, the custom admin must have privileges enabled for **Enrollment – Directory Sync**.

Before you can enable SSO, the Bots Admin must have logged on the Bots Admin Console using the log on credentials provided when signing up. After the Bots Admin configures and enables SSO, you can still access the Bots Admin Console directly at the following URL:

[https://bots.kore.ai/admin](https://bots.kore.ai/admin){:target="_blank"}

The following log on page is displayed and using your Bots Admin password credentials, you can log on to the Bots Admin Console and bypass SSO, if enabled.

<img src="../images/using-single-sign-on-img6.png" alt="Log on to Bots Admin Console" title="Log on to Bots Admin Console" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:70%;"/>

If you cannot remember your Bots Admin password, enter your email ID, and then click the **Forgot your password?** link shown in the previous image. An email is sent to your Kore.ai email account with instructions on how to reset your Bots Admin password.


## Logging Off

When you are finished with your session with the Bots Admin Console, you should log off the console and close your session to keep your bots account secure. To log off, click on your user name, and then click **Logout** as shown in the following illustration.

<img src="../images/using-single-sign-on-img7.png" alt="Log off from Bots Admin Console" title="Log off from Bots Admin Console" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:70%;"/>

If your Bots Admin Console session is idle for more than 15 minutes, your session is automatically terminated, and the next action in the session window will open the Kore.ai web client instead. To start a new session, click the **Bots Admin Console** <img src="../images/using-single-sign-on-img8.png"> icon and log on.
