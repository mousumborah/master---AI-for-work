# Kore.ai Connector

On the **Kore.ai Connector** page, in the **Security & Control** module of the Bots Admin Console, you can download and configure the Kore.ai Connector Agent for Bots within your secure company intranet to provide secure communications between the XO Platform in the cloud and your network.


## Why Kore.ai Connector?

Kore.ai Bots are designed to make updates, provide notifications to users, and perform tasks. The tasks to perform are received from or performed on third-party applications available over the Internet as web-based applications or on-premises bots applications.

In a Kore.ai bots on-premises system, communications security is maintained by restricting users and systems within the company intranet or by configuring specific channels for specific data exchange. On the contrary, Kore.ai Bots reside and process data in the cloud environment and cannot directly connect to your bots' premises applications.

You can use the Kore.ai Connector Agent to establish and maintain secure data connectivity between Kore.ai and your on-premises applications within your intranet.

The Kore.ai Connector is a stand-alone application that is installed and configured within your company intranet configured with restricted and secure connectivity to specified bots applications. The Kore.ai Connector Agent is designed to pass requests for data access between your on-premises applications and Kore.ai to process the specific Bot tasks configured by an end-user with rights and privileges for those applications.

The following illustration shows the **Kore.ai Connector** page in the Bots Admin Console **Security & Control** module.

## About

The Kore.ai Connector is an agent that runs behind your bots firewall within your company Intranet or perimeter network (DMZ) to provide secure data exchange between Kore.ai which operates in the cloud and your on-premises applications.

In the following diagram, end-users configure a Kore.ai Bot that connects to Kore.ai in the cloud. The Kore.ai Bot servers (5) contact the Kore.ai Connector Gateway (2) with the Bot request. The Kore.ai Connector Gateway relays the request to the Kore.ai Connector (3) installed and securely configured in your on-premises Intranet or DMZ to interact with your bots applications. The response from your applications is sent through the Kore.ai Connector back out to the Kore.ai cloud and processed. Optionally, you can enable your on-premises applications to push data, for example, alert messages, to the Kore.ai cloud using webhooks.

**How it Works**

After you install the Kore.ai Connector in your network, you configure the agent with details to specifically access, communicate, and request or post data to the bots application you define.

When started, the Kore.ai Connector Agent initiates a persistent SSL connection with Kore.ai and monitors requests for data transfer to or from your bots applications and Kore.ai. If the persistent connection is broken, the Kore.ai Connector automatically attempts to reestablish communication. You can monitor connectivity directly in the Bots Admin console.

Your security files are in-place on the application server.


## Configuring 

After you install the Kore.ai Connector Agent software, you must verify or set the properties for:

* **Certificate Information** – See `credentials` in the connectorconfig.json file.
* **Log Directories** – See `logger` in the connectorconfig.json file.
* **Cluster Environment** – See `cluster` in the connectorconfig.json file.
* **Proxy Control for Outbound Connections** – See `tunnel` in the connectorconfig.json file.
* **Access Control for Enterprise Applications** – See the accesscontrol.json file.

**Default Configuration Settings – connectorconfig.json**

This section shows the default configuration settings for certificate information, logging, and cluster mode settings in the &lt; **_Kore.ai Connector agent Installation Path_** >/config/connectorconfig.json file:

```
{
   "credentials":{
      "key":"./credentials/Kore.aiConnector.key",
      "cert":"./credentials/Kore.aiConnectorCert.pem",
      "ca":"./credentials/ca.crt"
   },
   "logger":{
      "applogs":{
         "path":"./logs",
         "level":"info"
      },
      "auditlogs":{
         "path":"./audits",
         "level":"info"
      }
   },
   "cluster":{
      "enabled":true,
      "workers":2
   }
}
```


**Certificate Information**

You may want to store the security keys for the Kore.ai Connector Agent in another location other than the installation directory for the Kore.ai Connector Agent. You can move the credential files to another directory on the application server or another server in the network and specify the relative or absolute path in the `credentials` section in the connectorconfig.json file that contains the following parameters:

* `key` – The client certificate. Default setting is:
`./credentials/Kore.aiConnector.key`
* `cert` – The .pem file generated in the Bots Admin Console. Default setting is:
`./credentials/Kore.aiConnectorCert.pem`
* `ca` –  Installed as part of the Kore.ai Connector Agent. Default setting is:
`./credentials/ca.crt`

**Logging Configuration**

The Kore.ai Connector Agent generates two logging files at runtime:

* kore-connector.log.&lt; **_dd-MM-yyyy_** > – Application logging events to include:
    * **Connector status** – Any change in status such as agent start or stop is added **as a log entry.**
    * **Errors** – Any error message for the agent is captured in the app.log file.

* kore-connector-audit.log.&lt; **_dd-MM-yyyy_** > – Audit logging events.
    * **Configuration changes** – Any changes in connectorconfig.json file and accesscontrol.json file. The original file is backed up automatically and a log entry is made.
    * **Requested URLs** – All requested URLs coming into the Kore.ai Connector are captured as a log entry.

By default, logging files for the application and auditing logs are created and stored in the default installation pat in the &lt; **_Kore.ai Connector Agent Installation Path_** >/logs and &lt; **_Kore.ai Connector Agent Installation Path_** >/audits. You can specify another directory on the application server or another server in the network and specify the full path.
You can also increase or decrease the logging levels as needed for either logging file as:



* **fatal** – Any error that is forcing a shutdown of the service or application to prevent data loss or further data loss. Occurs only once in a process and is usually the last entry in a log.
* **critical** – An error which requires immediate investigation that has not yet shut down a service or application, but is likely to do so.
* **error** – Any error which is fatal to the current operation but not fatal to the service or application, for example, cannot open a file, missing file, or missing data. This type of errors usually requires administrator intervention.
* **warn** – Anything that can potentially cause application abnormalities with the ability to recover, for example, switching from a primary to backup server, retrying, or missing secondary data.
* **info** – General information about normal application operations such as start and planning stopping of service, configuration assumptions, and so forth. This is the default setting for the Kore.ai Connector Agent.
* **debug** – Diagnostic information, usually for system administrators and IT personnel.
* **trace** – All operational information, for example, parts of a function.

Each log level below fatal includes the information from any logging level above. For example, the default level as info includes all the information for fatal, critical, error, warn, and info in the log file.

**Scalability and Cluster Configuration**

The Kore.ai Connector Agent is scalable to handle the request load as required. When you install the Kore.ai Connector Agent, cluster mode settings are enabled by default, with 2 workers, or CPUs, set for use.

For increased load handling for requests by the Kore.ai Connector Agent, you may want to enable more workers. If you do not want to use cluster mode, set the “enabled” property to false.

You can also run cloud connectors in more than one server to meet failover as well as scalability requirements. Certificate and other configurations will remain same. Cloud Connector is a client which makes outboud connection to Kore.ai Cloud Gateway. When more than one connectors are connected, Cloud Gateway will distribute the load to the connectors.

**Proxy Control for Outbound Connections**

You can configure outbound proxy settings for the Kore.ai Connector Agent in the &lt; **_Kore.ai Connector agent Installation Path_** >/config/connectorconfig.json file. This configuration is optional unless all of your outbound data is routed through a proxy server.
To configure outbound proxy settings, add the following configuration shown as the entry labeled tunnel_ _in the following configuration sample:


```
{
   "credentials":{
      "key":"./credentials/Kore.aiConnector.key",
      "cert":"./credentials/Kore.aiConnectorCert.pem",
      "ca":"./credentials/ca.crt"
   },
   "logger":{
      "applogs":{
         "path":"./logs",
         "level":"info"
      },
      "auditlogs":{
         "path":"./audits",
         "level":"info"
      }
   },
   "cluster":{
      "enabled":true,
      "workers":2
   },
   "tunnel":{
      "proxyHost":"hostname",
      "proxyPort":"portnumber"
   }
}
```


**Access Control for Applications**

The Kore.ai Connector Agent requires an explicit set of white-listed URLs to access specific applications on your company intranet. Any other HTTP requests are denied by the Kore.ai Connector.
You must configure access control for each bot application that will use the Kore.ai Connector Agent in the accesscontrol.json file in the Kore.ai Connector installation directory in the …/config/configs directory with the following parameters:

* **virtualhost** – Specify the virtual host name exactly as specified in the **Request URL** property in the **Set Up Request Chain** dialog while configuring on-premises bots in the Bot Builder tool. For more information, see [Defining a Request Chain Object](../../automation/use-cases/alert-tasks/){:target="_blank"} in the Bot Builder documentation.
* **virtualport** – Specify the virtual port exactly as specified in the **Request URL** property in the **Set Up Request Chain** dialog while configuring on-premises bots in the Bot Builder tool. For more information, see [Defining a Request Chain Object](../../automation/use-cases/alert-tasks/){:target="_blank"} in the Bot Builder documentation.
* **internalhost** – Specify the actual host name of the on-premises enterprise application used for data exchange with your Bots.
* **internalport** – Specify the actual port of the on-premises enterprise application used for data exchange with your Bots.
* **protocol** – Specify HTTP or HTTPS for the connection to on-premises enterprise applications.
* **allowedPaths** – Specify all paths as “/*” or a specific array of paths for the host, not to include any parameters. The Kore.ai Connector checks the path up to, but not including parameters beginning with " ? "

The following image is an example of a configured accesscontrol.json file with four Bot configurations.
