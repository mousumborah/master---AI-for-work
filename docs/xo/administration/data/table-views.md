# Table Views

Table Views let you create custom datasets by joining one or more Data Tables. These definitions get converted to queries to extract data from one or more data tables by using the required joins.


## Definition

Steps to create a table view:

1. Go to the **Data** tab in the Home page and select the **Table Views** option and click **Create Table View**.

        * For both types, you need to
            * select the **table;**
            * select the **columns** to be included in the view, you can use aggregation functions like `sum, avg, min, max and count`. Usage example: `count(&lt;table_name>.&lt;column_name>)`

            * the **criteria for filtering** the results using
                * column name – select from the drop-down list;
                * comparison operator – select from =, !=, &lt; or >
                * comparison value
                * you can have multiple filter criteria connected by AND/OR operators

            * the **Group By** columns for arranging the identical data into groups as `&lt;table_name>.&lt;column_name>`, and
            * the **Sort By** columns to order the results as `&lt;table_name>.&lt;column_name> asc/desc

        * In addition, for multiple tables view, you need to specify the **Join** criteria by configuring
            * **Table** to be joined;
            * the **type of join**– inner, right outer or left outer;
            * the **join columns** – pick from the drop-down list and
            * specify the **join criteria** using the operation =, !=, > or &lt; operators.
            * You can have multiple Join Rules. You can have up to 4 join rules.

## Share Table Views

The Kore.ai XO Platform allows you to share Table Views by assigning them to bots, process apps, or apps.

!!! Note

    In the Shared Views tab, you can view only the views shared with a user who has permission to view. When you share the tables views with users, they cannot edit or update the view definitions.

The bot or process developers can see the table view definitions using a [**Service node**](../data-as-service/){:target="_blank"}.
