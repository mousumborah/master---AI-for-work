# Bots Management Module

In the **Bots Management** module of the Bots Admin Console, you can deploy the bots developed by your company developers from the Kore.ai Bot Builder tool. When the developer develops a bot, it can be published for approval and deployment by the Bots Admin from the Bots Management section. From this section, you can

* Approve or reject custom bots sent for deployment approval,
* Deploy some or all of the tasks defined for a bot,
* Assign the deployed bot to users, or groups of users in your company for employees when the bot is defined for **Enterprise Use**, or for customers of your company when the bot is defined for **Consumer Use**.

## Deploying Bots

As the Bots Admin, you can manage the bots permission and consumption. After a developer publishes a custom bot from the Kore.ai Bot Builder tool to the Enterprise page at the Kore.ai Bot Store, the bot is displayed on the **Deployment Requests** page. Bots are not available to any users in your company until you approve the bot, and then assign that bot to one or more users, or customers for your company, depending on the bot deployment type defined as either for **Enterprise use** or **Consumer use**.

<img src="../images/bot-management-img1.png" alt="Deploying Bots" title="Deploying Bots" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:50%;"/>

You can select the following options to approve the bots in the Bot Management module:

* If Bots are set to be auto-approved by the Bots Admin in the **Bots Management** module **Preferences** page, when published by the developer, these Bots are immediately approved and deployed and are not displayed on the **Deployment Requests** page.
* If the bots are set to **Hold all deployment requests for manual admin approval. Bot cannot be used outside the developer environment until approved**. In this case, the Bots Admin has to approve the bots manually and assign users for bots. For more information, see [Bot Management Preferences](#preferences).


### Deployment Page Controls

For each Bot displayed on the **Deployment Requests** page, the following information and controls are displayed:

* **Bot Icon** – The icon displayed to the end-user in the client to identify the bot in the [Bot Store](https://bots.kore.ai/){:target="_blank"}.
* **Bot Name** – The name of the bot.
* **Bot Type** – The type of the bot – standard, universal etc..
* **Tasks** – number of tasks within the Bot
* **Version** – The type of bot for deployment. One of:
    * **New** – A new bot that has never been deployed.
    * **Upgrade** – A previously deployed bot that was upgraded and ready to be deployed.

* **Purpose** – The intended audience for the bot. One of:
    * **Consumer Use** – For enterprise customers and consumers.
    * **Enterprise Use** – For specified managed users of your enterprise.

* **Requested by** – The name of the developer submitting the bot for approval.
* **Requested on** – The date the developer submitted the bot for approval.
* **Reject/Publish** icons which will be visible on the hover over the row.
