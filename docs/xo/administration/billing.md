# Billing

The **Billing** section lets the Bot Admins view and track their Invoices and plan details.

## Billing Sessions

The Billing sessions are calculated based on

* Bot Usage (Usage Session)
    * A usage session is defined as ‘Fifteen minutes’ of user conversation with the bot. For example – If a user converses with the bot for 31 minutes, then it would be counted as 3 sessions (0-15, 16-30,31-End).
    * In the case of Human-agent transfer – If the user-bot interaction results in human agent transfer, the time spent with the human agent will be excluded from the bot session.

* Alerts Delivered (Alert Session)
    * Every alert delivered to a user will be counted as an Alert session. For example – If the user has set up to receive a sales report every 8 hours. In a day this user would consume 3 alert sessions.

For more information, refer to [Product-specific Billing Sessions](../manage-assistant/plan-and-usage/usage-plans.md#billing-session).

## Usage

Admin users can access detailed usage information for Bots and Apps directly in the Admin Console. For administrators managing multiple apps, it offers consolidated billing insights across all apps within a workspace, along with graphical representations of key billing metrics.

The dashboard provides a consolidated view of cumulative billing data, including Billing sessions, voice sessions, and agent counts, across all apps within the workspace. 

* Billing Sessions: Total number of completed sessions.
* Voice Sessions: The count of Voice Sessions in a conversation consumed in an App; calculated as every 15 minutes of interaction with the Virtual Assistant or an Agent.
* Agent Count: The count of agents subscribed to the plan for each app aggregated by Day/Week/Month.

Users can filter and view billing data for individual apps and refine the data further with date filters. They can select from predefined ranges such as 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days or set a custom date range. 

Billing metrics are shown using a graph or table, making it easy to understand usage patterns.

Hovering over a data point displays a tooltip with the following details:

* **Date**
* **Sessions**
* **Voice Sessions**
* **Agents**
