# Role Management

Roles and Permissions help in organizing the developer community based on the scope of their work.

* By default the roles of **Master Admin**, **Bot Owner**, **Bot Developer** and **Bot Tester** are created by the system.
* Each role has set of permissions allowed.
* You can edit the permission settings for Bot Developer and Bot Tester but not for Master Admin and Bot Owner roles.
* Users can be assigned to these roles, except Bot Owner which gets assigned when a User creates a Bot.

Apart from these the role of **Primary Master Admin** is created and assigned to the creator of the account.

These roles can be classified into:

* **[Admin Roles](#admin-roles)** which help in account management, and
* **[Bot Roles](#bot-roles)** which help in bot development.


## Admin Roles

An admin role is a set of pre-defined permissions for managing the user community. In this section, we talk about Admin roles, the permissions associated with them, how to create and assign these admin roles to users.

## Bot Roles

This section illustrates various Bot Roles, their permissions, steps to create custom Bot role and assign users to the same.

**Bot Roles** can be used to define permissions for accessing various components of a bot. These permissions include the ability to create tasks, train the bot, enable channels, enable extensions via SDKs, publish the bot and view usage analytics.

**Bot Owner**, **Bot Developer**, and **Bot Tester** are the three in-built bot roles that are available for all accounts. Creators of bots are automatically assigned to the _Bot Owner_ role.

You may create additional custom bot roles to meet your specific requirements. You can assign bot roles to bot developers either from Bot Builder or from the Bot Admin Console.

Following is the list of permissions that can be assigned to a Bot role:
