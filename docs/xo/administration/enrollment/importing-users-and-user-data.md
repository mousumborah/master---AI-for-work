# Importing Users and User Data

If you need to invite multiple Kore.ai users and you have information about users in addition to the email address, such as the **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Department**, **Phone**, and **Job Title**, you can use the **Import** page to add new users and update existing users based on a list that contains additional user information. The following illustration is an example of the **Import** page in the **Enrollment** module.

The import file can be a basic text file and saved as a .txt or .csv file format. After you create an import file, you can upload the file to add or update the Kore.ai users in your account.

### Create and Upload an Import File

You can create a file to invite users in your organization to become Kore.ai users that you can manage as a Bots Admin. This topic describes how to create a file that contains the email addresses and user information, such as first and last name, phone number, department, and so forth, for the users that you want to invite to become Kore.ai users in your account. If you only have email address information for your users, you should create and [import a bulk invite file](../enrolling-many-users/){:target="_blank"} instead. **To create an import file**

1. In a text editor or spreadsheet, enter the field IDs on the first line, and then enter a complete email address and data on each following line or in a comma-separated list as shown in the following example:  
  
    **For a .txt file:**
    ```
    Email ID, First Name, Last Name, Alternate ID, Work Phone, Title, Department, User Status
    Kore.aiUser1@kore.com,User1FirstName,User1LastName,User1AlternateID,800-555-1212,President,Executive,New
    Kore.aiUser2@kore.com,User2FirstName,User2LastName,User2AlternateID,800-555-5555,VicePresident,Executive,New
    Kore.aiUser3@kore.com,User3FirstName,User1LastName,,,,New
    ```

2. Save the import file as a .txt or .csv file, for example, Kore.aiImport.txt or Kore.aiImport.csv. After you create an import file, you can upload the file to invite your account users.
