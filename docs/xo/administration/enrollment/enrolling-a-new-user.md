# Inviting Users

You can use the **Invite** page to send join invitations to members of your organization. This is helpful if you have a few members to invite, for example, between one and ten. If you have many users to invite, you can [send bulk invitations](../enrolling-many-users/){:target="_blank} to join Kore.ai using a predefined list of members.

### Inviting Individual Users

You can invite one or more users to become Kore.ai users by defining their email address. **To invite users to your account:**


1. In the **Enrollment** module, on the **Invite** page, enter the email address of the member to invite, for example, example@kore.com.
2. Click **Send Invitations**.
3. An email invitation to join your Kore.ai account is sent to the user to become a Kore.ai user.
4. After you send invitations to enroll users in Kore.ai, the invitee must validate their email address to register as a Kore.ai user. Only after validation, will the user be available in your account.
