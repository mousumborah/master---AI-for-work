# Sending Bulk Invites to Enroll Users

On the **Enrollment > Bulk Invite** page, you can use a text file that contains email addresses of the users you want to join your account. This option is particularly useful to enroll a large number of members.

The import file should be a basic text file with one email address per line and saved as a .txt file format. After you create a bulk invite file, you need to upload the file.
