# Connect to API Node

This node lets you make synchronous or asynchronous requests using _SOAP_ or _REST API_ calls.

You can query or get information from an external system by defining a service request that includes configuring the APIs and passing the parameters.

## Configure the Node

### General Settings

Click the **General Settings** icon and configure the following:  
<img src="./../images/general-settings-api.png" alt="General Settings" title="General Settings" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

1. A **Custom Name** to identify the node.
2. Select an API **Type** from the following options:
    1. **REST**: A REST API conforms to the constraints of the REST API architecture and allows interaction with RESTful web services.
    2. **SOAP**: A SOAP API uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), which is a messaging protocol for interchanging data in a decentralized and distributed environment.
3. Select an **Integration Type** from the following options:
    3. **Synchronous**: The API returns resources, data, or services immediately.
    4. **Asynchronous**: The API returns resources, data, or services later based on the number of seconds you select. The default selection is 20s, and the available options range from 8s to 20s.
4. Under **Request Definition**, configure the API request. Define the _GET, PUT, POST_, or _DELETE_ service request, along with the API call and parameters to pass. To create a new request, click **+ Define Request**.

Define your API request by following the steps outlined in Define and Test an API Request, available below.

5. Under **Access Using URL Connector**, select “URLs are behind a firewall and a connector has been set up” if the API must be accessed using a configured URL connector.

#### Define and Test an API Request

To define and test your API request, follow these steps:

* In the **Request Definition** section within the API node’s General Settings, click **+ Define Request**.
* The **Define Request** window opens:
<img src="./../images/define-request-window.png" alt="Define Request" title="Define Request" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">
* Select the _GET, PUT, POST, PATCH,_ or _DELETE_ call from the list.
<img src="./../images/api-method.png" alt="Method" title="Method" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">
* Paste your _API call URL_ in the text field and click **Test**.
<img src="./../images/curl.png" alt="cURL" title="cURL" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">
* Your API call runs successfully if all the inputs provided are valid. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.
* Provide the details for the **Header Key** and **Value** pair. You can add a new pair by typing it in the empty fields. You can delete a pair by clicking the **Delete** (Bin) icon next to it.

* Click **Test Request** and paste the request body code in the text field. The text editor provides the following options:
    * Format JSON data with indentation and line feeds,
    * Compact JSON data by removing white spaces,
    * Sort contents,
    * Filter, sort, or transform contents,
    * Repair JSON,
    * Undo the last action,
    * Redo action.

* Click **Save** after you’ve tested the API successfully.

### Connection Rules

* Click the **Connection Rules** icon and select the actions that you want the node to trigger when the API call is successful and when the API call fails.
* For **On Success**, the selected **Go to node** defines how the bot handles a successful API call.
* For **On Failure**, the selected **Go to node** defines how the bot handles a failed API Call.

### Error Handling

Use this section to handle system errors during customer interactions.
<img src="./../images/error-handling-api.png" alt="Error Handling" title="Error Handling" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:70%;">

* **Your Message to User**: The message that will be played or displayed to the customer. Select one of the following options from under **Choose your message type**:
    * **Text to speech**: This option allows you to transcribe text to speech. Type the text to be transcribed in the textbox or select an already configured message.
        * Click **+ Create New** to create a new prompt for the text-to-speech message type. Enter a name for your message and type its contents.
        * Define multiple message types for the prompt message to be played to the customer by clicking **+ Add Another**. In this case, one message will be randomly selected and played during runtime.
