# Flow Nodes

The Flow Designer canvas lets you configure nodes representing various flow components.

The Start node is the starting point of any flow and is available by default. You can drag and drop it (as well as any other nodes) anywhere on the canvas.

## Rearrange Nodes

To rearrange nodes on your canvas, drag and drop them to the desired location.

!!! Note

    Only the node that you are dragging will change position. Any connecting nodes will remain in place, regardless of the direction of their connection.

## Connect Nodes

Node connections are either made within the configuration of each node or by dragging and dropping the nodes on the canvas. The steps are the following:

1. Click the **+** and move the cursor to the node you want to connect.
2. A line should now be drawn between the nodes, with an arrow indicating the direction of the node connection.

## Edit/Delete Node Connections

To edit/delete node connections, click the line connecting two nodes. The line is highlighted and a  pop-up is displayed with the following options:

* Bend line connector,
* Straight line connector,
* Change line color,
* Delete connector.

**Delete Node Connection**: Click the **Delete** button to delete the connection. The nodes remain on the canvas but will not be connected anymore. To ensure a working flow, you must create another connection between the nodes or remove unnecessary nodes. See the _Delete Nodes_ section below for details.

**Delete Node**: Click the **Delete** button. A confirmation pop-up is displayed. Click **Confirm** to delete the node.

!!!Note

    * You cannot restore deleted nodes unless you have previously saved a version that contains them. Restoring a version also means that you may lose other changes you made to the flow. Please proceed with caution. See [Restore Versions](../../deploy/bot-versioning.md#restoring-versions) for details.
    * You cannot delete the Start node.
