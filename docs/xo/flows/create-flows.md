# Create Flows

A _flow_ is a step-by-step process that helps you define the end-to-end customer experience for each communication channel.

You can create experience flows using the Flow Designer.

## Flow Types

There are two types of Flows:

1. **Start Flows**: Most flows are classified as start flows, applicable to both voice and chat channels.
2. **Exit Flows**: Used when a call disconnects, applicable to voice channels.

### The Start Flows

Start flows represent the most complex flow type, providing access to all [node types](../flows/node-types/introduction-to-flow-nodes.md). This flow type allows you to create experiences for inbound calls and chats.

!!! Note

    All fields of the default Start Flows can be edited except Channels. [Learn more](#edit-a-start-flow).

### The Exit Flows

This flow type runs when a call gets disconnected and is useful in gathering customer data during post-call analytics, clean-up, or updates in other systems after a call ends. Conversational context can be passed from the main experience flow into the _Exit Flows_.

!!! Note

    Exit flows are currently configurable only for voice channels.

## Create a Start Flow

Steps to create a Start Flow:

1. In the left navigation, go to **Flows & Channels** > **FLOWS**.
2. Click **+ New Start Flow**.

3. In the New Start Flow window, provide inputs for the following fields:
    1. **Start Flow Name**: This name will help identify the flow.
    2. **Description**: Input text to describe what the experience flow does or its purpose.
    3. **Attach a Channel**: Select one of the following channels to integrate with this flow:

### Voice

1. Selecting this option displays the list of phone numbers available within your account. Select a number to map to the start flow.

#### Bot No Input

To handle situations where there are delays in backend operations or unexpected system failures, administrators can configure Bot No Input to to provide users with appropriate responses or cues. This prevents users from experiencing dead air during such occurrences. The following configurations allow pre-programmed instructions for such scenarios.  
<img src="../images/bot-no-input.png" alt="Bot No Input Toggle" title="Bot No Input Toggle" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* When enabled, the below configurations are applied.
* When disabled, the default give-up timeout is applied, causing the call to disconnect if the bot does not respond within 30 seconds.

##### Configuration Options

###### Bot No Input Timeout

* If the bot does not respond within this duration, an action based on the "Interaction Type" is triggered.
* This periodic message will repeat until the bot responds or until the "Bot No Input Give Up Timeout" is reached.  
<img src="../images/timeout.png" alt="Bot No Input Timeout" title="Bot No Input Timeout" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

###### Interaction Type

The following options are available:

* **Bot No Input Speech**: Enter the text that the bot will say when triggered by the no input timeout.
* **Bot No Input URL**: Enter a valid audio URL. The bot will play the audio file from this URL when triggered by the no-input timeout.  
<img src="../images/interaction-types.png" alt="Interaction Type" title="Interaction Type" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

###### Bot No Input Retries

* Specifies the number of times to perform the no input actions, with a "Bot No Input Timeout" duration between each retry.  
<img src="../images/retries.png" alt="Bot No Input Retries" title="Bot No Input Retries" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

###### Bot No Input Give Up Timeout

* The total duration (in seconds) to wait before performing the give-up action and stopping further no input retries. The following options are available:

    * **End the Call**: Ends the call after the "Bot No Input Give Up Timeout" is reached.
        * Enter a message that the bot will say before ending the call.  
            <img src="../images/end-the-call.png" alt="End the Call" title="End the Call" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    * **Transfer the Call**: Transfers the call to a SIP phone number.
        * **Text Message**: The bot will say this message before transferring the call.
        * **SIP Transfer Method**: Select the desired SIP transfer method from the dropdown menu (SIP REFER).
        * **Redirect URL**: Enter the SIP redirect URL for transferring the call.
        * **SIP Headers**: Provide key-value pairs for SIP headers as needed.  
            <img src="../images/transfer-the-call.png" alt="Transfer the Call" title="Transfer the Call" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

##### Usage Scenarios

* **Normal System Delays**: If backend operations take longer than expected (for example, CRM updates or HTTP requests), users will receive periodic messages or audio cues, ensuring they remain informed.
* **Unexpected Failures**: In cases of backend crashes or offline services, this provides fallback actions to maintain a positive user experience.

##### Example Configuration

**Scenario**:

* Configuration:
    * **Enabled**: true
    * **Bot No Input Timeout**: 10 seconds
    * **Bot No Input Speech**: "Please wait while the bot responds."
    * **Bot No Input Retries**: 15
    * **Bot No Input Give Up Timeout**: 120 seconds
    * **Give-Up Action**: End Call (message: "Bot not responding ending the call")

**Behavior**:

* The bot will play the message "Please wait while the bot responds" every 10 seconds.
* This will continue until the bot responds, the retries (15) are exhausted, or the give-up timeout (120 seconds) is reached.
* After 120 seconds, if the bot still does not respond, the bot will say the configured end-call message "Bot not responding ending the call" and disconnect the call.

This configuration ensures that user interactions remain seamless and informative, even during unexpected system delays or failures.

* Select an **Exit Flow** (Optional): When the exit event is triggered, the published version of the selected flow will be executed. You can either select the default _Exit Flow_ or one that you have created yourself.
<img src="../images/exit-flow.png" alt="Exit Flow" title="Exit Flow" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* Select a **No Agents Available Flow** (Optional): The published version of the selected flow will be executed when an agent transfer is triggered, but no agents are available, or the conversation exceeds the maximum waiting time in the queue. You can either select the default _No Agents Available Flow_ or one that you have created yourself.
<img src="../images/no-agents-available-flow.png" alt="No Agents Available Flow" title="No Agents Available Flow" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

* Select an **Out-of-Hours Flow** (Optional): The published version of the selected flow will be executed when an agent transfer is triggered outside the queue's working hours. You can either select the default _Out-of-Hours Flow_ or one that you have created yourself.
<img src="../images/out-of-hours-flow.png" alt="Out of Hours Flow" title="Out of Hours Flow" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    !!! Note

        Only flows that have been published will be available for selection in the dropdowns.

#### Chat

Selecting chat will display all the chat channels configured in the channels section. The displayed values include:

1. **All**: Selecting it selects the Web/Mobile Client and any other services available within your account for the chat flow.
2. **Web/Mobile Client**: The web client is the front-end component of any conversational AI system or application that communicates with a server and is accessed by the end-user on a desktop or mobile device.  
<img src="../images/chat-channels.png" alt="Chat Channels" title="Chat Channels" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

3. Under Advanced Settings, you can enable **Prompt Overrides at Input Nodes**. When this feature is enabled, unprocessed user inputs will be passed to the first input node encountered in the flow without returning the actual prompt stored against the input node. This is useful for scenarios where a conversation ends and is then restarted by the user. For example, the user will not see the first “Welcome Message” again, as they would when starting a new conversation. Instead, they will receive a relevant reply to the utterance.
<img src="../images/prompt-overrides-at-input-nodes.png" alt="Prompt Overrides at Input Nodes" title="Prompt Overrides at Input Nodes" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

4. Select a **No Agents Available Flow** (Optional): The published version of the selected flow will be executed when an agent transfer is triggered, but no agents are available, or the conversation exceeds the maximum waiting time in the queue.
<img src="../images/no-agents-available-flow-chat.png" alt="No Agents available Flow" title="No Agents Available Flow" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">
