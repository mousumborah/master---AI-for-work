## Integration Steps

To enable integration between Search AI and Slab and ingestion of content from Slab, 



* Generate an Access Token in Slab
* Configure the Slab Connector in Search AI


## Generate Access Token in Slab

Search AI communicates with Slab using its APIs.  To enable this communication, an access token is required, which is tied to a special bot-type user associated with the organization. This token is private and should not be shared. To generate this token,

* Go to the **Admin console** on the Slab application. 
* Click the profile name on the top right and go to **Settings**. Go to the **Developer **page from the left menu. 
* **Reveal API Token** for the Slab bot. This token is used to configure the Slab connector in Search AI.

## Configure Slab Connector in Search AI

Go to the **Authorization page** of the Slab Connector, provide the following configuration fields, and click **Connect**. 

* **Name**- Unique name for the connector.
* **Slab Bot Token**- Provide the API Token here.  


## Ingesting Content

After successfully connecting the Search AI connector to the Slab account, go to the **Configuration** tab and set up content synchronization. For immediate sync, use the **Sync Now** option and the **Schedule Sync** option to set up a scheduler to sync the content in the future. 

Upon sync, Search AI ingests details from the **posts** into the Search AI application.
