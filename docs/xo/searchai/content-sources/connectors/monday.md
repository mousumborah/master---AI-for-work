# Monday Connector

Monday is a work operating system used to plan, track, and manage workflows, projects, and team collaboration. It features customizable boards that allow users to manage workflows, assign tasks, and visualize progress across projects.

SearchAI enables ingesting content from **items within boards** on Monday, making them searchable and enhancing accessibility.

### Monday Connector Configuration in Search AI

Provide the following fields while configuring the Monday connector in Search AI. 

1. **Name**: Unique identifier for the connector. 
2. **Authorization Type**: Select Personal Access Token or OAuth 2.0. Personal Access Token here refers to the userâ€™s global API token. For OAuth 2.0, provide the client credentials. 

The following properties are used to map the content from the Monday application to SearchAI application. Currently, only standard fields are supported, hence it is not mandatory to provide all the other fields.

## RACL Support

Currently, access control is implemented for the Monday Connector in Search AI using the **BoardID **of the board. For every item in the board, the `sys_racl `field contains the board ID as a permission entity. To associate users with this permission entity, use the [Permission Entity APIs](../../../apis/searchai/permission-entity-apis.md).
