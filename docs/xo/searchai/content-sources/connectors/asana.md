## Prerequisites

* Admin account with access to the required projects and tasks. 

## Authorization Support

Search AI supports the **OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant type** to access the content on Asana. 


## Asana OAuth Client Set Up

This requires creating a client application on the Asana application. Follow the steps listed below to create the app. 

* Go to the [Asana developer console](https://app.asana.com/). 
* Create a new app and provide the basic details.  
* Go to the OAuth page and enter the Redirect URL. Depending upon your region or the deployment, you can use one of the following URLs as the Redirect URL.
  * JP Region Callback URL: [https://jp-bots-idp.kore.ai/workflows/callback](https://jp-bots-idp.kore.ai/workflows/callback)
  * DE Region Callback URL: [https://de-bots-idp.kore.ai/workflows/callback](https://de-bots-idp.kore.ai/workflows/callback)
  * Prod Callback URL: [https://idp.kore.com/workflows/callback](https://idp.kore.com/workflows/callback)
* Copy the client credentials for the app. These credentials are used to configure the Asana connector in Search AI.
* Go to the Manage Distribution page and set the distribution method to ‘Any Workspace’. 
* Save Changes. 

Refer to[ this page](https://developers.asana.com/docs/oauth#register-an-application) for detailed instructions. 


## Search AI Connector Configuration

Provide the following details to configure the Asana connector. 

* Name - Unique name for the connector.
* Authorization Type - Set it to OAuth 2.0
* Grant Type - Authorization Code
* Client ID - ID of the client credentials generated for the OAuth application. 
* Client Secret - Client secret generated for the OAuth application. 

Click **Connect** and use the Asana credentials to grant access to the Search AI application to access content from the application. 


## Ingesting Content

After the Search AI connector is successfully connected to the Asana application, go to the **Configuration** tab and set up content synchronization. For immediate sync, use the **Sync Now** option and the **Schedule Sync** option to set up a scheduler to sync the content at a future time. 


## Ingested Content Format

Asana Connector currently ingests only **Projects** and the **Tasks** associated with the projects into the Search AI application. 

* For Projects, the following fields are fetched and added to the **content** field of the ingested content. 
    * Project Description
    * Project Owner
    * Completed
* For Tasks, the following fields are provided in the **content** field of the ingested content.
    * Task Description
    * Project
    * Completed
    * Comments

Note that subtasks and attachments to the tasks are not included in the ingested content. raw_data field of the ingested content includes more information about the ingested content. 


## RACL Support

Currently, Search AI supports fetching projects and their associated tasks from Asana. 

For public **projects**, the sys_racl field is populated with the workspace or organization id and for private projects, the sys_racl field is populated with the project id. 

For **task** data ingested in the Search AI application, the sys_racl field is populated with one or more project IDs that the task is associated with. If any of those projects is a public project, the sys_racl field for the task is set to organization ID. 

To associate users to the project ID or the workspace ID, use the [Permission Entity APIs. ](https://docs.kore.ai/xo/apis/searchai/permission-entity-apis/)
