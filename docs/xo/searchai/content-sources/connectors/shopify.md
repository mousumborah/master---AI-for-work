## Content Ingestion

The Shopify connector is designed to ingest **blog articles** from your Shopify account seamlessly. Please note that only the articles published or visible at the time of sync are ingested into the Search AI app, ensuring that only accessible content is utilized for search functionalities. If the visibility status of an article is updated after the sync, the changes will reflect in Search AI only after the next sync. 

The content field in the ingested document contains the textual content of the blog, while the metadata like author, labels, and URL are captured in specific fields.
