# DialogGPT Rollout Plan

The implementation of DialogGPT is planned in three phases:

* Phase 1 (included in XO v11.8): Focuses on core capabilities like the main DialogGPT flow, RAG pipeline, conversation orchestrator, and handling of common conversation intents.
* Phase 2 (future release): Introduces advanced features such as Universal Bot support, granular intent identification, batch testing, custom entity extraction, and support for new XO GPT models and commercial models.
* Phase 3 (future release): Includes extended capabilities like multilingual support and implementation of guardrails.
