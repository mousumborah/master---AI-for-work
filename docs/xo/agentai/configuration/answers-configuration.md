# Configure Search AI
## Overview

Search AI provides an intelligent, contextual, and personalized experience in every interaction across web and mobile channels. Users have the flexibility to select the built-in Search AI functionality or the custom Search AI apps:

* **None**: No Search AI functionality.
* **Use Search AI Configurations from the current app**: Uses the in-built Search AI app that comes with the current XO11 app.
* **Link Search AI Configurations from a different app**: Users can configure up to three customized Search AI apps.

## Link Search AI Configurations from a different app

To enhance the search capabilities of Agent AI and allow restricted access for targeted users, you can configure up to three Search AI apps with the following scopes:

* **Internal Information**: This feature can be leveraged to send internal notes to agents. Agents can’t share the search results with customers as it doesn’t include the **Send** / **Copy** buttons. The following screenshot shows internal information related to the search words "national pension":

* **External Information**: This feature helps fetching external information through the Search AI apps, and this information has **Send** / **Copy** buttons for sharing with customers.

* **Auto-Suggestions**: Access to auto-suggestions (prompts) only. The following screenshot shows auto-suggestions related to the search word "pizza":

## How Does It Work?

1. **Set up Search AI Apps**: Add all the segregated information sources (internal information, external information, and auto-suggestions) the targeted agents might need in their searches, like web pages, data, documents, and content from apps like ServiceNow and Confluence.

2. **Link Search AI with Agent AI**: Administrators can link up to three Search AI applications with Agent AI, as explained in this document. Once linked, Search AI content is automatically available for Agent AI as a service in runtime.

3. **View Search AI data in Agent AI**: In the Agent AI widget, agents can view relevant snippets and articles from the Search AI application, and Dialog Tasks and FAQs from the XO Platform or the Use Cases of the Agent AI application.

## How Does It Help Agents?

When Agent AI is integrated with Search AI, data from all the sources configured in the Search AI application are accessible to agents via the Agent AI widget > **Search** tab. In the search results, Snippets and Articles are shown from the Search AI application, and Dialog Tasks and FAQs are shown from the Use Cases of the Agent AI application. Agents can quickly review the search results and share relevant information with the customers. This feature also enables sending internal notes to agents with important, agent-only information that can’t be sent or copied to customers.
