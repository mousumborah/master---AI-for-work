## Integrated Architecture for Omnichannel Customer Engagement

The image below provides a high-level understanding of the XO Platform's capabilities, the integrated nature of its components, and how they work together to support customer engagement across multiple channels.

<img src="../images/xo-platform-components-flow.png">


1. Entry channels serve as the first point of contact, including Digital channels, Voice Gateways, and third-party IVR systems.

2. These channels feed into the Start or Exit flows, which handle the initial and final stages of interactions. The flow can branch out into an appropriate customer service flow, depending on the implementation.

3. Customer service flows:
    
    * Automation flow: The flow uses an Intelligent Virtual Assistant to handle complex interactions with AI. In addition, Search AI retrieves information from vast datasets and feeds the most relevant information to users using the Virtual Assistant.

    * Agent transfer flow: The flow routes requests to live agents through the Contact Center or Agent Desktop. Agents receive AI-powered assistance during customer interactions. The flow can also connect with third-party Contact Centers.

4. Supporting systems:

    * Campaigns work with the Contact Center to manage outbound voice and web marketing efforts.
    
    * Analytics gathers data to provide insights into user interactions and system performance.
    
    * App Management handles the platform's administrative tasks such as publishing, importing/exporting apps, user management, collaboration, and billing.
