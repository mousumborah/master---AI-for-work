# Adding the Yammer Channel

To add Yammer as a channel to your Kore.ai bot, you must create an app in Yammer and enable the platform to receive messages. Adding the Yammer channel to your Kore.ai bot allows end-users of your bot to interact with your bot using their _Yammer_ accounts. To add the Yammer channel to your bot, you must:


1. **Register an App**– To enable Yammer as a channel for your bot, create an app on Yammer. Log in to your _Yammer_ developer account to _Register a New App_. Initially, to enable the Yammer channel, you must create and register for a developer account in the Yammer Developer portal.
2. **Enter the Redirect URL** – Copy the _Redirect URL_ provided in the **Configurations** tab of the Yammer channel page in the Bot Builder and enter it in the **Redirect URL** field to proceed with creating an app on Yammer.
1. **Get App Information**– Go to the App Details page to get and reserve the **Channel ID** and **Channel Secret** for your channel configuration.
2. **Deploy Bot to your Enterprise**– To allow your enterprise users to discover the bot in the App Directory, you can deploy the bot by updating the **App Directory** section.
3. **Authorize**– You must _Authorize_ the bot from the **Configurations** tab on the Yammer Channel page in the bot builder. This allows you to generate a developer access token to enable the Kore.ai bot platform to access the app.
4. **Enable Channel**– After setting up the Yammer app and entering configuration data in Bot Builder, enable the channel.

!!! note

    The Callback/Redirect URL now includes the **_streamid_** in the API request to identify the virtual assistant being accessed. When an incoming request is qualified with this identifier, it helps with traceability, troubleshooting, and remediation at the network level during anomalies like malicious calls or unusual bot activity.
