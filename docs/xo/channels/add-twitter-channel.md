# Adding the Twitter Channel

To set up Twitter as a channel, you must associate the bot with a Twitter account, define a Twitter app, and enable the integration. To add Twitter as a channel, follow the below steps:



1. **Create Twitter App** - Log in to Twitter. In _Twitter App Management Console_, create an app to provide authorization for communication between Twitter and your Kore.ai bot.
2. **Setup Keys and Tokens** - Generate the authentication keys and tokens for the _Twitter_ app to communicate with the XO Platform, and then copy those keys and tokens to Kore.ai Bot Builder.
3. **Update Permissions** - To use _Twitter_ as a channel for your Kore.ai bot, you must define the _Twitter_ app permissions used to interact with the XO Platform.
4. **Enable Channel** - After setting up the _Twitter_ app and entering configuration data in Bot Builder, you must enable the channel.

To complete this procedure, you must create a _Twitter_ account if you do not have one already.

    The steps are modified in v7.1 of the platform in sync with changes to the channel requirements.

    The Callback URL now includes the **_streamid_** in the API request to identify the virtual assistant being accessed. When an incoming request is qualified with this identifier, it helps with traceability, troubleshooting, and remediation at the network level during anomalies like malicious calls or unusual bot activity.
