# Adding the WeChat Channel

To set up WeChat as a channel, you need to register for a WeChat Official Account. You also need to enable webhook integrations for the XO Platform to send and receive messages.

Please refer to the WeChat Official Accounts [Registration Process](https://admin.wechat.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?t=ibg_en/en_faq_tmpl&type=info&lang=en_US) for more information.

For development purposes, you may also use the WeChat Sandbox environment to integrate the assistant and test functionality. This article takes you through the setup process.
