# Adding the Mattermost Channel

You can connect Kore.ai assistants to your Mattermost account using either:



* [Webhook based integration](#webhook-based-integration)
* [WebSocket based integration](#websocket-based-integration).

Before you begin, ensure that you have access to the administrative functions of your Mattermost account.

## WebSocket based Integration


### Step 1: Enable Personal Access Tokens

To enable a WebSocket connection, you would need to create a Mattermost account to be provisioned as a bot.


1. First, enable usage of Personal Access Tokens to allow your Mattermost users to generate personal access tokens.
2. Personal access tokens are used to authenticate and provide full access to an account.
    * Login to Mattermost from an account that has access to _System Console_.
    * Go to **System Console > Integrations > Integrations Management**.
    * Locate the **Enable Personal Access Tokens** setting, set it to **true**, and **Save**.

### Step 2: Create an Account to be Provisioned as a Bot



1. From your Mattermost account, go to **Integrations > Bot Accounts > Add Bot Account**.
2. Configure the Bot’s details:
    * Choose a **Username**.
    * Add an **Icon**, a **Display Name**.and a **Description**.
    * Choose the **Member** role.
    * Select **additional permissions** for the account:
        * **_post:all_** to allow the bot to post to all Mattermost channels including direct messages.
        * **post:channels**: to allow the bot to post to all Mattermost public channels, but not in direct messages or private channels.
    * Click **Create Bot Account** to complete the setup.

3. A success page will be shown to you next, where you will also find the access token you can use to connect to this assistant.
