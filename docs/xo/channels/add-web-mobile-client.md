# Adding the Web/Mobile Client Channel

To use any Kore.ai Bot SDKs, you must first register your app to get the authentication credentials to communicate between the Kore.ai bot and your application hosting the bot. The Kore.ai bot SDKs can be used to add a chat widget to your company application that enables users to chat with the application using natural language input. The Kore.ai bots platform interprets the user input, processes the request, and responds to the user.

The bots Platform accepts requests only from authorized clients for connection and exchanging messages. To authorize the connection, you must register your app and get the required client credentials. The credentials authorize the client app and provide for user assertion.
This topic describes how to register your application and generate credentials for your clients that are required to exchange messages between your application and the Kore.ai bots Platform and then configure and add the Web/Mobile Client Channel to your bot.

To add the Web/Mobile Client Channel to your bot, you must first register or create an app in Bot Builder. When you create an app, you are provisioning credentials for your application to communicate securely with Kore.ai servers. After you create an app, you can use that app registration in the configuration to add the Web/Mobile Client Channel to your bot.


## Add Web/Mobile Client Channel

The Web/Mobile Client channel can be configured using the following options:

**Associate an App**

* When you choose to enable Web/Mobile client, an app is automatically created for you
* You can choose to replace this app with any other app that you may want to use

Steps to create your own app:

1. Open the bot on which you want to add the Web/Mobile Client channel.

2. On the bots menu, click **Channels & Flows** > **Channels** > **Digital** > **All** > **Web/Mobile** **Client**.

3. In the **Select App** drop-down list, select your existing app registration or click **Add App** to create a new app.

4. In the **Name** field, enter the name for the app registration used in Bot Builder. For example, **weather app**.

5. Select one of these scopes for the app:
    * **Allow anonymous users to chat with the bot**: Enables anonymous users to interact with the bot.
    * **Auto register new users on Kore.ai Bots Platform**: Select to control the auto-user registration in Kore.ai if the user assertion is unknown.

6. In the **JWT Signing Algorithms Used For Client App Authentication** drop-down list, select one of the following security algorithms:
    * **RS256/RS512**: Select to enable the **Public Key.** _The Private key, used for encryption, is provided by the user, and the Public key, used for decryption, is provided by the Platform_. Both the keys have to be used for generating the token. The Public Key is used by the XO Platform to authenticate the client application.
    * **HS256/HS512**: Select to generate a **Secret Key** and a **Client ID**. The **Client ID** is required for app initialization, and the **Secret Key** is used by the XO Platform to authenticate the client application.

7. (Optional) In the **Push Notifications** section, click **Enable** and then specify a URL to send the notifications.

9. To customize the display messages for the push notifications messages sent to the client app, select one of the following options:
    * **Send Original Messages** – Sends the actual conversation message as part of the push notification.
    * **Show a standard message from standard responses** – Sends a generic message instead of the original message.
