## Billing Session

### Key Billing Rules

* Automation AI and Search AI: Billed per 15-minute of activity.
* Contact Center AI and Agent AI: Billed per Agent Seats (named or concurrent).
* Add-ons: Billed separately. 

### Product-Specific Billing Sessions

* Automation AI: A billing session is 15 minutes of user conversation with the bot. For example, if a user converses with the bot for 31 minutes, it would be counted as 3 sessions (0-15, 16-30, 31-End).
* Search AI: This is included in Automation AI, and the same billing session is applied. 
* Contact Center AI: It’s billed per the agent seats:
    * Named Seats: Each agent gets a dedicated seat. For example, if 100 agents work across 3 shifts, you will be billed for 100 seats.
    * Concurrent Seats: This is based on the maximum number of simultaneously logged-in agents. For example, if a maximum of 50 agents work per shift across 3 shifts (150 total agents), you will be billed only for 50 seats.  
* Agent AI: It’s billed per the agent seats, similar to Contact Center AI as explained above.
* Add-ons: They are billed separately from the plan. For details, see the Add-ons and Services section on the [pricing](https://kore.ai/pricing/) page.

### Usage Trends

This section allows app users to access detailed billing information, helping them stay informed about their expenses and effectively track Apps’ usage. The dashboard provides a consolidated view of cumulative billing data, including Billing sessions, voice sessions, and agent counts.

* Billing Sessions: Total number of billing sessions completed, encompassing automation AI interactions and API requests.
* Voice Sessions: Total number of voice-based interactions across products, including Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and calls via the Voice Gateway.
* Agent Count: Concurrent Agent Seats that the customers have subscribed to for the given time.  

!!! note
   
    The Agent Count is not displayed for enterprise customers.


Users can filter and view billing data for individual apps and refine the data further with date filters. They can select from predefined ranges such as 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days or set a custom date range.

Billing metrics are shown using a graph or table, making it easy to understand usage patterns.

Hovering over a data point displays a tooltip with the following details:

### Credit/Debit Card

Initiate the transaction for paid credits using a valid credit/debit card. Add the _card number_, _account holder’s name_, _expiry date_, and _CVV security code_ to authorize the transaction and validate using an OTP.

### Wire Transfer

Select the wire transfer payment mode while adding funds. A wire transfer is a form of electronic payment that sends money directly from one bank account (Payer) to another (Payee).

**Important Considerations**

* **View Order Details**: When you place an order by selecting the wire transfer method, it gets registered with pending payment clearance status. The order summary page provides you the total amount to transfer along with the break-up summary. Meanwhile, you should also receive an email from Paypro with the detailed steps to complete your Wire Transfer order. 
 
  <img src="../images/up(12).png" alt="order details" title="Order details" style="border: 1px solid gray;"/>

* **Ability to Add Funds during pending Wire Transfer**: A Wire Transfer process may take four to eight days to complete. The paid credits are loaded only after the transfer is successful. If the VA runs out of balance and your Wire Transfer order is still in ‘Pending’ status, you can add funds using an alternative payment method like a credit card or PayPal.

## Deployment Flow

The admin can take action for a Standard Workspace app deployment request based on the following scenarios:

**Standard Workspace with Free Credits**

The admin user can approve a deployment request without constraints/checks or any plan selection flows if the workspace has free credits.

**Standard Workspace without Free Credits**

If the standard workspace has exhausted all the free credits, the admin cannot approve the publish request until funds/ credits are added to the account.

**Standard Workspace with Paid Credits**

If an account has paid credits, then the admin user can approve the deployment flow.

## Emails and Notifications
