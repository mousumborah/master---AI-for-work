# Agent Leaderboard

This **Agent Leaderboard** feature allows auditors and managers to view both top and bottom-performing agents, along with their conversations. This helps to make informed decisions regarding incentives and coaching assignments. Based on the agents' rankings, it becomes easier to identify and assign coaching assignments to lower-performing agents as needed. The agent leaderboard widget shows all the agents across queues and channels with a functionality to sort across all the columns.

You can view **Agent Leaderboard** by navigating to **Contact Center AI** > **Quality AI** > **Analyze** > **Agent Leaderboard**.

!!! Note

    If the **Agent Scorecard** toggle view is disabled in the **Settings** of Quality AI by the administrator for a particular agent, then the agent cannot start any automated agent scoring. 

The Agent Leaderboard widget shows all the agents across queues and channels which includes the following list of items:

* **Agents**: This shows the agent name and queue that it belongs to.
* **Agent Score Card**: This shows the number of scorecards assigned to the agent and the agent score (across all queues).

!!! Note

    If you designate a scorecard as the default, the system shows the score based on that default scorecard. If no default scorecard is set, then the system displays the average score from all applicable scorecards for that agent.

* **Total Interactions**: This shows the total number of interactions or overall number of interactions terminated by the agent during the specified time period.

* **Kore Evaluation Score**: This shows the average Kore Evaluation Score against each interaction audited.

* **Supervisor Audit Score**: This shows the average manual audit score of the agents for the audited interactions during the specified time period.

* **Coaching Assignments**: This shows the number of coaching assignments or sessions assigned to the agent for the selected time period.
* **Fail Percentage**: This shows the failure percentage across all interactions.

* **Search**: This allows you to search for agents that are part of the same queues that an agent belongs to.

!!! Note     
    
    By default, the Agent Leaderboard displays data from the past 7 days.
