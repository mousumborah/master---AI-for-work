# Conversation Mining - Interactions


This **Interactions** feature allows you to quickly view scored interactions or evaluation data. You can apply filters to highlight specific interactions or those with the greatest potential for improvement, and you can save these filters for auditing purposes. The interactions displayed on this page are limited to the user's assigned queues.

## Accessing Interactions

You can access **Interactions** by navigating to **Contact Center AI** > **Quality AI** > **Analyze** > **Conversation Mining** > **Interactions**.

!!! Note

    Interactions are populated a few seconds after call termination. 

## Interactions Dashboard Elements

The **Interactions** dashboard includes the following elements:

* **Agents**: Shows the agent's name who last engaged in and ended the interaction. Hover over the agent’s name to view tagged topics and intents.

    * **Topic Tags**: Displays classified topics for each interaction as tags. Hover over the tags to see all relevant topics discussed in that conversation.

* **Actions**: Allows you to assign the interaction to a bookmark for later reference.  
<img src="../conversation-mining/images/actions-tags.png" alt="Moments" title="Moments" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">


    !!! Note

        To view and tag the bookmarks for future reference, you must create the required bookmarks during the [Settings](../configure/settings.md) configuration. 

* **Queues**: Shows the queue where the system terminated during the interaction.

    !!!Note

        The evaluation form used to score the interaction corresponds to the queue where the system terminated the interaction. 

* **Kore Evaluation Score**: Shows the Kore Evaluation score (Auto QA Score) for the interaction based on the relevant evaluation form.
* **Sentiment Score**: Shows the system-generated sentiment score for the interaction based on the customer conversation context. 
* **Supervisor Auditor Score**: Shows the Supervisor Audited score if the interaction is already audited or manually evaluated. 
* **Moments**: Shows the **Moments** column counts for adherences, violations, and omissions related to the configured metrics of the interaction.  
<img src="../conversation-mining/images/conversation-mining-moments.png" alt="Moments" title="Moments" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

When you hover over the listed **Moments**, the following metrics are displayed: 

* **Questions Adherences**: By Question Metrics that are met during the conversation. 
* **Violations**: Speech-based violations that occurred.
* **Omissions**: Metrics not adhered to; including playbook steps, dialog tasks, and by question metrics.


Clicking on an interaction opens the corresponding AI-Assisted Manual Audit page, where you can view the conversation history and the recording. [Learn more](../ai-assisted-manual-audit.md){:target=”_blank”}.   

<img src="../conversation-mining/images/conversation-mining-interaction-filters.png" alt="Interactions Filters Audit Page" title="Interactions Filters Audit Page" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

Auditors can check the following near-miss scenarios by reviewing metrics on the audit screen:

* **Evaluation Marking**: If an agent's adherence is close to the required standard but not fully met, the system marks the evaluation as "No" and highlights similarities to fully adhered cases for easier comparison.

* **Click-Through Navigation**: The system provides clickable links (View) for near-miss agent utterances, similar to those for adhered cases, allowing for a more detailed review.

* **Near-Miss Criteria**: Near-miss criteria are determined by predefined similarity thresholds. These thresholds help flag and navigate near-miss utterances close to adherence standards. The system marks the evaluation as **Yes** in green and highlights the customer response when the **View** button is clicked.

### Self-Assignment for Audit

**Assign to me**: On the **Conversation Mining** page, you (auditors or supervisors) can assign interactions to themselves for auditing while reviewing conversations. The auditors can submit their audited interactions even if no by-question metrics are available. [Learn more](../ai-assisted-manual-audit.md){:target=”_blank”}.

## Columns

Allows you to filter the following default fields:


* **Supervisor Auditor Score**: This shows the Supervisor Audited score if the interaction has already been audited/manually evaluated.

* **Sentiment Score**: This shows the system-generated sentiment score for the interaction based on the context of what the customer said in the interaction.

* **Start Time**: This shows a specified time format of the conversation in the interaction listing page (for example, 24th May, 2024, 1:17:10 PM). 

* **Duration**: This shows call duration (voice and chat), including talk time, hold time, and after-call work time. For example, 0h 6m 25s.

## Bookmarks

Allows you to assign the interaction to a bookmark and displays all the bookmarks that a given interaction has been assigned to.  
<img src="../conversation-mining/images/conversation-mining-interaction-bookmarks.png" alt="Bookmarks" title="Bookmarks" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

5. From the **Agents** list, add the agent name based on the queue selected.  
<img src="../conversation-mining/images/agents.png" alt="Agents" title="Agents" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    !!! Note

        You can filter the **Agent Groups**, who are part of the queues, not based on agents in the agent group that are part of other queues.

6. Enable either of the following options:
    * **Average handling time**: Filters interactions based on the start and end of handling time range of interaction.    
    <img src="../conversation-mining/images/handling-time.png" alt="Average Handling Time" title="Average Handling Time" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    * **Filter by deviation from AHT**: Filters interactions by % deviation from the average handling time across all interactions for the respective date range and the interactions that are going wrong.  
      <img src="../conversation-mining/images/deviation-from-aht.png" alt="Filter by deviation" title="Filter by deviation" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">  

    * Specify the **Deviation of** % number.  
    <img src="../conversation-mining/images/deviation-of.png" alt="Deviation of" title="Deviation of" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:80%;">

    * If **No. of Transfers** is selected, then specify the filters by the number of transfer that occurred within each interaction.

Note that the customer churn is calculated once per interaction. Customer churn is not to be calculated as a score.

#### Escalation

This detects the number of escalations raised to the Supervisor by a customer.

### Filter by Behaviour

**Metric Name**

This filter allows you to view interactions based on a specific evaluation metric, where you can filter by selecting Pass or Fail options. The selected metric appears as a tag below the input field, which you can remove by clicking the cross button to hide the Metric Qualification field. When you access the Conversation Mining page through the Adherence Heatmap, the filter settings are automatically applied.
