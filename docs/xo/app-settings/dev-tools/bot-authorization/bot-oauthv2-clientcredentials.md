# Setting Up Authorization using OAuth v2 client credentials

OAuth v2 is the new version of the open protocol to allow secure authorization via a standard method from web, mobile, and desktop applications.

To use oAuth v2, you must first register an account with the web application as you will need the sign in credentials for that application to configure the settings for the Authorization Mechanism.

The Client Credentials grant type is used when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user.


## Configuring oAuth v2 Using Client Credentials

To configure this authorization method for your assistant, follow these steps:

1. Open the assistant for which you want to configure an Authorization profile.
2. From the left menu, click **App Settings**, then select **Dev Tools > Authorization Profiles**.
3. Click **New**. The **New Authorization Mechanism** dialog opens.

4. In the **Authorization Type** drop-down list, select **oauth v2 client credentials**.
5. In the **Name** field, enter the name for your authorization.

The following illustration shows the **oAuth v2** fields that you must define to enable authorization for your assistant.

Please define the fields as explained in the following table:

   <td><strong>FIELD NAME</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

   <td>Set to oAuth v2 Client Credentials.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Identity Provider Name

  <tr>
   <td>Token Request URL
   </td>
   <td>The URL used by the Kore.ai application to obtain an unauthorized request token. A request token is a value used by the Kore.ai application to obtain authorization from the end-user to obtain an access token.

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Scope

  <tr>
   <td>Refresh Token URL

## Authorization Fields

By default, authorization fields are configured as part of the header of the task request message. If your task request requires additional authorization fields or the expected authorization is not part of the header, for example, a verification code, click **+ Add Authorization Field** and then define the fields as shown in the following illustration. 

<img src="../images/oauth-v2-clientcredentials-img3.png" alt="Authorization fields" title="Authorization fields" style="border: 1px solid gray;zoom:80%;"/>

1. In the **Field Type** field, you can select one of the following depending on where in the task request message and the type of authorization fields that are required.
    1. **Header** – The VA expects the authorization fields as part of the header of the request.
    2. **Payload** – The VA expects the authorization fields as part of the content of the body of the request.
    3. **Query String** – The VA expects the authorization fields as a query in the body of the request.
    4. **Path Param** – The VA expects the authorization fields as part of the URL path for the request.

2. In the **Field Key** field, enter the name of the field for the selected **Field Type**.
3. In the **Field Value** field, enter the value for the **Field Key** specified.
4. Click **Done**. The new authorization field is added in the **Authorization Fields** section.


## Testing the Authorization

After you save the authentication, you can test your authorization definition on the **Authentication** page when you click **Test** before continuing to develop the remaining steps of your task. When you click **Test**, the test is executed using the authentication token URLs and the **Client ID** and **Client Secret Key**. If tenancy was defined, the **Test Authorization** dialog is displayed.

Click **Test** to begin the authorization test.

When the validation of authorization is complete, the results of the validation, either success or failure, are displayed. If the authorization fails, the _Auth Test Failed_ message is displayed along with the **Headers** and **Response** tabs as shown in the following illustration.
