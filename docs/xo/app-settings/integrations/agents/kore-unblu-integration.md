# Kore-Unblu Integration

## Overview

Unblu is a conversational platform that allows agents and advisors in your organization to collaborate with your customers and website visitors. It enables collaboration through online channels like live chat, secure text messaging, and video chat to achieve a better customer experience.

Transferring a chat to a human agent from the bot is necessary if your bot is in the space of customer service. Chatbots are not meant to completely replace humans. At times, the chatbot fails to answer satisfactorily or the user wants to chat with a human being. If this happens, the chatbot should transfer the chats to a human agent or a customer care representative. To help users accomplish this task, Kore can be integrated with the Unblu application.

Here, the bot is the core of the entire solution. Apart from performing all its functionalities, the bot also acts as a proxy between users and agents.

* **Bot**: Chat Bot that the user interacts with.
* **Users**: Users are the customers who are using this bot.
* **Agent**: Agents are humans who chat with users. The agent will also need a chat window. For this, you can use _Unblu_ software.


## Prerequisites

The prerequisites are listed below:

* A fully functional bot.
* An Unblu account.
* Download BotKit SDK from Koreâ€™s [GitHub](https://github.com/Koredotcom/BotKit){:target="_blank"}.
* Download and install the &lt;_Node.js_> file. The BotKit SDK requires &lt;_node.js_> files to run on the same server where the SDK is installed. The &lt;_node.js_> version must be v12.0 and above.
* Ngrok to simulate the callback server application.
