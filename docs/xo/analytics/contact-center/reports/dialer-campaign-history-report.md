While generating reports you have two options, Run On Demand and Schedule.

**Run On Demand**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the report's schedule can be set to run on demand.

**Schedule**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the report's schedule can be changed. The schedule option is the standard way to generate a report. If the report is scheduled for later, it will automatically be generated on the scheduled day and time without clicking Run.

10. Click the **PDF/Page** icon and generate the output of that report.
