## Generating Interaction Details by Segment Report

The Interaction Details by Segment Report is a comprehensive report that covers how all interactions were processed for each segment.

To generate Interaction Details by Segment Report:

1. On the Reports tab, click **New Report**.
2. In the list of reports, choose the **Interaction Details by Segment** report.
3. Enter the **Report Name** and **Report Description**.
4. Select a **Time Period**.
5. Select **Data Filters**.
6. Select **Report Generation** and choose from the following options:
        * Schedule
            * Run On Demand
            * Schedule
        * Select Format
            * CSV
        * Send To (single email address or a mailing list)
7. Click **Create**.

8. An instance of the Interaction Details by Segment report is generated.  
    <img src="../images/segment-report-created.png" alt="Report Created" title="Report Created" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">

9. Click the **Run** icon next to the instance of the report.  
    <img src="../images/segment-run-report-button.png" alt="Run Report" title="Run Report" style="border: 1px solid gray; zoom:100%;">  

    While generating reports you have two options, Run On Demand and Schedule.  
    **Run On Demand**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the schedule of the report can be set to run on demand.  
    **Schedule**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the schedule of the report can be changed. The use of the schedule is the standard way to generate a report. If the report is scheduled for later then it will automatically be generated on the scheduled day and time without the need to click Run.
10. Click the CSV icon and generate the output of that report, as shown below.
