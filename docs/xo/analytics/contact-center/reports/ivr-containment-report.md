# IVR Containment Report
## Generating the IVR Containment Report

The IVR Containment Report shows data on all incoming calls. It is a comprehensive report covering all calls made, callers identified, and shows per intent data and outcomes of these conversations on a daily basis. This report requires that the bot designer use certain predefined message tags to be emitted during the execution of intents. This report is applicable for voice calls only.

To generate the IVR Containment Report:

1. On the Reports tab, click **New Report**.
2. In the list of reports, choose the **IVR Containment Report**.
3. Enter the **Report Name** and **Report Description**.
4. Select the **Time Period**.
5. Select the **Data Filters**.
6. Select Report Generation and choose from the following options:
    * Schedule
        * Run On Demand
        * Schedule
    * Select Format
        * CSV
    * Send To (single email address or a mailing list)
7. Click **Create**.
8. The IVR Containment Report is generated.

While generating reports you have two options, Run On Demand and Schedule.

**Run On Demand**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the schedule of the report can be set to run on demand.

**Schedule**: While creating a new report or editing an existing report, the schedule of the report can be changed. The use of the schedule is the standard way to generate a report. If the report is scheduled for later then it will automatically be generated on the scheduled day and time without the need to click Run.

10. Click the **CSV** icon and generate the output of that report, as shown below.
