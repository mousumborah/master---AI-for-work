# Custom Agents 

Configurable AI agents designed for quick deployment and workflow integration with minimal setup:

* **Prompt Agents**: Build custom **GPT** agents capable of executing specific tasks by responding to tailored prompts, user inputs, and knowledge. [Learn more](./prompt-agents.md).

* **Workflow Agents**: Create agents that integrates tools in Agent platform, enhancing interaction and enabling smooth workflow execution. [Learn more](./workflow-agents.md).

* **Bot Agents**: Connect your **XO** bot to create agents that smoothly integrate and interact with it, enabling seamless workflow execution. [Learn more](./bot-agents.md).

* **Search Agents**: In AI for Work, RAG agents are implemented through **Search AI** applications that index content from various sources, allowing them to retrieve relevant information and generate precise responses to user queries. [Learn more](./search-agents.md)

* **Enterprise Knowledge Agents**: Agents which are pre-configured **Search AI** app that acts as a backup system when specific agents can't handle user queries, providing general search capabilities without any specialized focus. [Learn more](./enterprise-knowledge.md)

* **API Agents**: API-based agents built by configured through a no-code builder. By connecting to external data sources, these agents fetch and deliver answers/data based on user queries through 3rd party API execution. [Learn more](./api-agents.md).

* **Agentic Flow**: AllowsÂ multiple AI agents to execute sequentially in order to efficiently complete and automate complex operations. [Learn more](./agentic-flows.md).

* **Autonomous Agent**: AI-powered solutions that utilize Agent platform to autonomously manage complex tasks and workflows. [Learn more](./autonomous-agent.md).
