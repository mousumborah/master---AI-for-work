# Email Template

Email templates assist in communicating with recently invited individuals to join the account. These templates are straightforward and customizable, allowing users to tailor the content to suit their needs.

* Users have full control over the content of the email. They can edit the body and subject, with the default subject and body available for convenience.
* Users can click to view the email sent to the invited user and preview the drafted email, ensuring clarity and accuracy.
* The templated invited message and the accept invitation message cannot be edited, maintaining consistency for critical communications.
* The last custom admin can make final adjustments to the email template before sending it to ensure it meets the desired standards.
