# Audit Log Management

Audit Log is a tracking mechanism designed to monitor and record all administrative and operational activities across your AI for Work platform. This system creates a comprehensive trail of user actions, providing enhanced security, accountability, and compliance capabilities for enterprise environments.

## Core Functionality

The Audit Log System captures activities in three distinct but interconnected locations, each serving a specific purpose within your security infrastructure:

**Admin Hub Logs**: Admin Hub logs function as the centralized repository for all administrative configuration activities. These logs record system-level changes that affect the entire platform.

These logs provide visibility into:

* User management operations
* Security setting modifications
* Assistant configuration changes
* Workspace creation and management activities

Access to Admin Hub logs follows a hierarchical permission structure:

* Full admins can view all Admin Hub logs
* Custom admins can only view logs related to modules they have permission to access

**Workspace Logs**: Workspace logs document all activities that occur within specific workspace environments. These logs create accountability for team-specific actions and provide workspace administrators with visibility into collaborative activities.

Workspace logs track:

* Collaborator additions or removals
* Permission changes
* Workspace configuration modifications
* Resource allocation adjustments.

**Agent Logs**: Agent logs capture the most granular level of activity, tracking all interactions and modifications related to specific agents. These logs enable detailed forensic analysis of agent configuration changes. Users with edit access or ownership permissions for an agent can access its logs, ensuring that those responsible for agent management have complete visibility into its history.

Agent logs record:

* Agent creation and modification events
* Publishing status changes
* Configuration adjustments
* Integration modifications

## Log Entry Structure

Each log entry contains comprehensive metadata to facilitate detailed analysis and investigation.

**User Information**

* Full username of the person who performed the action.
* Email address associated with the user account.

**Module Identification**

* Specific module where the activity occurred.
* Dynamic identification based on location:
    * For Admin Hub: User Management, Security, Assistant configurations, or Workspace management.
    * For Workspaces: Type of agent.
    * For Agents: Specific page within the agent interface.

**Activity Details**

* Concise description of the action performed.
* Contextual information explaining the nature and impact of the activity.

**Temporal Data**

* Precise timestamp recording the exact date and time of the activity.
* Consistent time format for standardized chronological analysis.

## Advanced Filtering Capabilities

The system provides powerful filtering tools that enable efficient log analysis and investigation:

* **Date Range Filtering**: Narrow log view to specific time periods using intuitive date selection controls.
* **User Filtering**: Focus on activities performed by specific individuals.
* **Module/Sub-Module Filtering**: Filter by functional areas using a dynamic single-select control that adapts based on the current log context.


## Data Export Functionality

For compliance reporting, investigations, or record-keeping, the system supports exporting filtered log data:

* Export to CSV format with a single click
* Maintain all data fields and relationships in the exported file
* Apply current filters to export only relevant data subsets

## System Integrity

The Audit Log System is designed with several critical integrity features:

* **Real-time Logging**: Every administrative action is recorded instantly when performed
* **Cross-location Consistency**: Log entries maintain consistent format and content across all three logging locations
* **Complete Coverage**: The system guarantees no missing or duplicate entries
* **Tamper Resistance**: All logs are read-only to prevent modification

The Audit Log System provides a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to activity tracking that supports security, compliance, and operational excellence. By implementing this logging infrastructure, organizations gain complete visibility into administrative actions while maintaining appropriate access controls.
