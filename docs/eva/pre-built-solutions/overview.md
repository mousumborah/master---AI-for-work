# Pre-built Solutions Overview

**Pre-Built Solutions** offer a suite of AI-powered tools designed to streamline various organizational workflows, reduce repetitive tasks, and improve operational efficiency. These solutions come with core features tailored to automate and enhance specific departments.

**IT Assist** and **HR Assist** are now being integrated to work together seamlessly. When combined with AI for Work, they can serve as unified agents for end-users, offering a consolidated support experience. This integration allows organizations to leverage the strengths of each solution, providing employees with comprehensive support and faster resolutions through a single, intelligent interface.

For example, when a user submits a query related to ticketing, AI for Work automatically triggers the **IT Assist** bot, enabling a real-time conversation to address the userâ€™s needs efficiently. By accessing the **Go to Workbench** feature, admins are taken directly to the workbench of the linked **IT Assist** account.
