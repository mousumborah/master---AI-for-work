# Authorization

An API key identifies and authorizes users, granting access rights to the API.
It simplifies the authentication process by allowing users to provide a single
key instead of a username and password combination. To access the API, the user
must include their personal API key in the request headers.

## Accessing the Personal API Key

Steps to generate and manage your key:

1.  Click on the profile icon located in the lower-left corner of the admin
    dashboard and select **My profile**.
