# Account Hub

The Account Hub serves as the central control panel for all administrative tasks within the system. It provides a unified platform for managing user accounts, assigning roles and permissions, monitoring system activity, and generating reports. This centralized approach streamlines administrative processes, improves efficiency, and enhances overall system security.
