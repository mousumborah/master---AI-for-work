# Analytics Overview

The Analytics provides a history of all administrative tasks via the Dashboard view and the Data view. The views display the key performance metrics, trends, and reports, enabling you to gauge its real-time usage and performance. 

The following screenshot shows an example of the Analytics Dashboard view in the Admin Console. You can easily switch between the **Dashboard view** and the **Data view** using the switcher at the top right corner of the page.
