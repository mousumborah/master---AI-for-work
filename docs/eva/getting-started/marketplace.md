## Key Components

**Types of AI for Work agents Available**

The marketplace organizes AI for Work agents into two primary sections:

Apps: Agentic Apps represent more complex, multi-functional AI solutions. Think of these as comprehensive digital assistants that can handle multiple related tasks. Each Agentic App comprises multiple individual agents working together to provide a complete solution. All created Agentic flows will appear in this section.

Agents: Agents are the individual AI components that can function independently. The marketplace features **Prompt Agents**, these are straightforward AI assistants that respond to text prompts. They don't connect to any external systems but can provide information, generate content, or answer questions based on their training.

### Finding the Right Agents

The marketplace offers several ways to find the agents you need:

Text Search: Enter keywords describing your needs, and the marketplace will display relevant matches.

Filtering Options: To refine your search, use the following three filtering options:

* **Team Filter**: Shows agents designed for specific teams like Marketing, Sales, or All Teams for general-purpose agents.
* **Category Filter**: Groups agents by function, such as Content Generation, Lead Tracking, or Personal Productivity.

### Understanding Agent Cards

Each agent in the marketplace appears as a card with essential information:
