# IP restriction 

This document provides instructions for setting up IP address restrictions. With IP restriction, administrators can control access to ensure that only authorized IP ranges can interact with the application. 

By default, users can access AI for Work from any IP address, as long as they have valid credentials.

Additionally, you can restrict access to a specified range of IP addresses. When you specify a list of IP addresses in the **Restrict** section, users within your account attempting to access the Platform from any other IP addresses will be restricted.

## Restrict Access

Administrators have two options for access control:

1. **No Restriction**: Users can access the account from any IP address.
2. **Restrict Access**: Users are limited to specific IP addresses or IP ranges as defined by the administrator.

 **Steps to Restrict Access**

1. **Select Access Option**:
    * **No Restriction**: Allow all users to access from any IP address.
    * **Restrict Access**: Limit access to specified IP addresses only.
2. **Add IP Range**:
    * You can add individual IP addresses or ranges to allow access.
    * Click **Add field** to insert a new row for each IP address or range.
    * In each row, enter the **IP Address** range and provide a **Description** and **Name** to identify the range.
3. **Edit and Delete IP Ranges**:
    * Once added, hover over an IP range to view **Delete** icon, which can be used to remove unwanted ranges.
4. **Save Configuration**:
    * After entering valid IP ranges, the **Save** button will be enabled.
    * Click **Save** to apply the restrictions.
