# Connector

You can ingest content into the application using connectors from various sources, including third-party repositories. This feature enables you to set up and configure connectors within your environment, allowing the application to connect with third-party services. Once the connection is established and authentication is completed, data from the third-party application is ingested, indexed, and made available to respond to search queries. Access privileges for the content are maintained according to the permissions assigned to the user in the third-party repository.
